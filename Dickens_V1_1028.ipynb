      "far above the light and murmur of the town and far below the flying\n",
      "clouds that shadow it, is the wild and dreary place at night: and high up\n",
      "in the steeple of an old church, dwelt the Chimes I tell of.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were old Chimes, trust me.  Centuries ago, these Bells had been\n",
      "baptized by bishops: so many centuries ago, that the register of their\n",
      "baptism was lost long, long before the memory of man, and no one knew\n",
      "their names.  They had had their Godfathers and Godmothers, these Bells\n",
      "(for my own part, by the way, I would rather incur the responsibility of\n",
      "being Godfather to a Bell than a Boy), and had their silver mugs no\n",
      "doubt, besides.  But Time had mowed down their sponsors, and Henry the\n",
      "Eighth had melted down their mugs; and they now hung, nameless and\n",
      "mugless, in the church-tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not speechless, though.  Far from it.  They had clear, loud, lusty,\n",
      "sounding voices, had these Bells; and far and wide they might be heard\n",
      "upon the wind.  Much too sturdy Chimes were they, to be dependent on the\n",
      "pleasure of the wind, moreover; for, fighting gallantly against it when\n",
      "it took an adverse whim, they would pour their cheerful notes into a\n",
      "listening ear right royally; and bent on being heard on stormy nights, by\n",
      "some poor mother watching a sick child, or some lone wife whose husband\n",
      "was at sea, they had been sometimes known to beat a blustering Nor’\n",
      "Wester; aye, ‘all to fits,’ as Toby Veck said;—for though they chose to\n",
      "call him Trotty Veck, his name was Toby, and nobody could make it\n",
      "anything else either (except Tobias) without a special act of parliament;\n",
      "he having been as lawfully christened in his day as the Bells had been in\n",
      "theirs, though with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my part, I confess myself of Toby Veck’s belief, for I am sure he had\n",
      "opportunities enough of forming a correct one.  And whatever Toby Veck\n",
      "said, I say.  And I take my stand by Toby Veck, although he _did_ stand\n",
      "all day long (and weary work it was) just outside the church-door.  In\n",
      "fact he was a ticket-porter, Toby Veck, and waited there for jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a breezy, goose-skinned, blue-nosed, red-eyed, stony-toed,\n",
      "tooth-chattering place it was, to wait in, in the winter-time, as Toby\n",
      "Veck well knew.  The wind came tearing round the corner—especially the\n",
      "east wind—as if it had sallied forth, express, from the confines of the\n",
      "earth, to have a blow at Toby.  And oftentimes it seemed to come upon him\n",
      "sooner than it had expected, for bouncing round the corner, and passing\n",
      "Toby, it would suddenly wheel round again, as if it cried ‘Why, here he\n",
      "is!’  Incontinently his little white apron would be caught up over his\n",
      "head like a naughty boy’s garments, and his feeble little cane would be\n",
      "seen to wrestle and struggle unavailingly in his hand, and his legs would\n",
      "undergo tremendous agitation, and Toby himself all aslant, and facing now\n",
      "in this direction, now in that, would be so banged and buffeted, and\n",
      "touzled, and worried, and hustled, and lifted off his feet, as to render\n",
      "it a state of things but one degree removed from a positive miracle, that\n",
      "he wasn’t carried up bodily into the air as a colony of frogs or snails\n",
      "or other very portable creatures sometimes are, and rained down again, to\n",
      "the great astonishment of the natives, on some strange corner of the\n",
      "world where ticket-porters are unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, windy weather, in spite of its using him so roughly, was, after all,\n",
      "a sort of holiday for Toby.  That’s the fact.  He didn’t seem to wait so\n",
      "long for a sixpence in the wind, as at other times; the having to fight\n",
      "with that boisterous element took off his attention, and quite freshened\n",
      "him up, when he was getting hungry and low-spirited.  A hard frost too,\n",
      "or a fall of snow, was an Event; and it seemed to do him good, somehow or\n",
      "other—it would have been hard to say in what respect though, Toby!  So\n",
      "wind and frost and snow, and perhaps a good stiff storm of hail, were\n",
      "Toby Veck’s red-letter days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wet weather was the worst; the cold, damp, clammy wet, that wrapped him\n",
      "up like a moist great-coat—the only kind of great-coat Toby owned, or\n",
      "could have added to his comfort by dispensing with.  Wet days, when the\n",
      "rain came slowly, thickly, obstinately down; when the street’s throat,\n",
      "like his own, was choked with mist; when smoking umbrellas passed and\n",
      "re-passed, spinning round and round like so many teetotums, as they\n",
      "knocked against each other on the crowded footway, throwing off a little\n",
      "whirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings; when gutters brawled and\n",
      "waterspouts were full and noisy; when the wet from the projecting stones\n",
      "and ledges of the church fell drip, drip, drip, on Toby, making the wisp\n",
      "of straw on which he stood mere mud in no time; those were the days that\n",
      "tried him.  Then, indeed, you might see Toby looking anxiously out from\n",

soon as\\npossible, I beg it to be noticed that I confine this observation neither\\nto young people nor to little people, but extend it to all conditions of\\npeople: little and big, young and old: yet growing up, or already growing\\ndown again—there are not, I say, many people who would care to sleep in a\\nchurch.', 'I don’t mean at sermon-time in warm weather (when the thing has\\nactually been done, once or twice), but in the night, and alone.', 'A great\\nmultitude of persons will be violently astonished, I know, by this\\nposition, in the broad bold Day.', 'But it applies to Night.', 'It must be\\nargued by night, and I will undertake to maintain it successfully on any\\ngusty winter’s night appointed for the purpose, with any one opponent\\nchosen from the rest, who will meet me singly in an old churchyard,\\nbefore an old church-door; and will previously empower me to lock him in,\\nif needful to his satisfaction, until morning.', 'For the night-wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and round a\\nbuilding of that sort, and moaning as it goes; and of trying, with its\\nunseen hand, the windows and the doors; and seeking out some crevices by\\nwhich to enter.', 'And when it has got in; as one not finding what it\\nseeks, whatever that may be, it wails and howls to issue forth again: and\\nnot content with stalking through the aisles, and gliding round and round\\nthe pillars, and tempting the deep organ, soars up to the roof, and\\nstrives to rend the rafters: then flings itself despairingly upon the\\nstones below, and passes, muttering, into the vaults.', 'Anon, it comes up\\nstealthily, and creeps along the walls, seeming to read, in whispers, the\\nInscriptions sacred to the Dead.', 'At some of these, it breaks out\\nshrilly, as with laughter; and at others, moans and cries as if it were\\nlamenting.', 'It has a ghostly sound too, lingering within the altar; where\\nit seems to chaunt, in its wild way, of Wrong and Murder done, and false\\nGods worshipped, in defiance of the Tables of the Law, which look so fair\\nand smooth, but are so flawed and broken.', 'Ugh!', 'Heaven preserve us,\\nsitting snugly round the fire!', 'It has an awful voice, that wind at\\nMidnight, singing in a church!', 'But, high up in the steeple!', 'There the foul blast roars and whistles!', 'High up in the steeple, where it is free to come and go through many an\\nairy arch and loophole, and to twist and twine itself about the giddy\\nstair, and twirl the groaning weathercock, and make the very tower shake\\nand shiver!', 'High up in the steeple, where the belfry is, and iron rails\\nare ragged with rust, and sheets of lead and copper, shrivelled by the\\nchanging weather, crackle and heave beneath the unaccustomed tread; and\\nbirds stuff shabby nests into corners of old oaken joists and beams; and\\ndust grows old and grey; and speckled spiders, indolent and fat with long\\nsecurity, swing idly to and fro in the vibration of the bells, and never\\nloose their hold upon their thread-spun castles in the air, or climb up\\nsailor-like in quick alarm, or drop upon the ground and ply a score of\\nnimble legs to save one life!', 'High up in the steeple of an old church,\\nfar above the light and murmur of the town and far below the flying\\nclouds that shadow it, is the wild and dreary place at night: and high up\\nin the steeple of an old church, dwelt the Chimes I tell of.', 'They were old Chimes, trust me.', 'Centuries ago, these Bells had been\\nbaptized by bishops: so many centuries ago, that the register of their\\nbaptism was lost long, long before the memory of man, and no one knew\\ntheir names.', 'They had had their Godfathers and Godmothers, these Bells\\n(for my own part, by the way, I would rather incur the responsibility of\\nbeing Godfather to a Bell than a Boy), and had their silver mugs no\\ndoubt, besides.', 'But Time had mowed down their sponsors, and Henry the\\nEighth had melted down their mugs; and they now hung, nameless and\\nmugless, in the church-tower.', 'Not speechless, though.', 'Far from it.', 'They had clear, loud, lusty,\\nsounding voices, had these Bells; and far and wide they might be heard\\nupon the wind.', 'Much too sturdy Chimes were they, to be dependent on the\\npleasure of the wind, moreover; for, fighting gallantly against it when\\nit took an adverse whim, they would pour their cheerful notes into a\\nlistening ear right royally; and bent on being heard on stormy nights, by\\nsome poor mother watching a sick child, or some lone wife whose husband\\nwas at sea, they had been sometimes known to beat a blustering Nor’\\nWester; aye, ‘all to fits,’ as Toby Veck said;—for though they chose to\\ncall him Trotty Veck, his name was Toby, and nobody could make it\\nanything else either (except Tobias) without a special act of parliament;\\nhe having been as lawfully christened in his day as the Bells had been in\\ntheirs, though with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing.', 'For my part, I confess myself of Toby Veck’s belief, for I am sure he had\\nopportunities enough of forming a correct one.', 'And whatever Toby Veck\\nsaid, I say.', 'And I take my stand by Toby Veck, although he _did_ stand\\nall day long (and weary work it was) just outside the church-door.', 'In\\nfact he was a ticket-porter, Toby Veck, and waited there for jobs.', 'And a breezy, goose-skinned, blue-nosed, red-eyed, stony-toed,\\ntooth-chattering place it was, to wait in, in the winter-time, as Toby\\nVeck well knew.', 'The wind came tearing round the corner—especially the\\neast wind—as if it had sallied forth, express, from the confines of the\\nearth, to have a blow at Toby.', 'And oftentimes it seemed to come upon him\\nsooner than it had expected, for bouncing round the corner, and passing\\nToby, it would suddenly wheel round again, as if it cried ‘Why, here he\\nis!’  Incontinently his little white apron would be caught up over his\\nhead like a naughty boy’s garments, and his feeble little cane would be\\nseen to wrestle and struggle unavailingly in his hand, and his legs would\\nundergo tremendous agitation, and Toby himself all aslant, and facing now\\nin this direction, now in that, would be so banged and buffeted, and\\ntouzled, and worried, and hustled, and lifted off his feet, as to render\\nit a state of things but one degree removed from a positive miracle, that\\nhe wasn’t carried up bodily into the air as a colony of frogs or snails\\nor other very portable creatures sometimes are, and rained down again, to\\nthe great astonishment of the natives, on some strange corner of the\\nworld where ticket-porters are unknown.', 'But, windy weather, in spite of its using him so roughly, was, after all,\\na sort of holiday for Toby.', 'That’s the fact.', 'He didn’t seem to wait so\\nlong for a sixpence in the wind, as at other times; the having to fight\\nwith that boisterous element took off his attention, and quite freshened\\nhim up, when he was getting hungry and low-spirited.', 'A hard frost too,\\nor a fall of snow, was an Event; and it seemed to do him good, somehow or\\nother—it would have been hard to say in what respect though, Toby!', 'So\\nwind and frost and snow, and perhaps a good stiff storm of hail, were\\nToby Veck’s red-letter days.', 'Wet weather was the worst; the cold, damp, clammy wet, that wrapped him\\nup like a moist great-coat—the only kind of great-coat Toby owned, or\\ncould have added to his comfort by dispensing with.', 'Wet days, when the\\nrain came slowly, thickly, obstinately down; when the street’s throat,\\nlike his own, was choked with mist; when smoking umbrellas passed and\\nre-passed, spinning round and round like so many teetotums, as they\\nknocked against each other on the crowded footway, throwing off a little\\nwhirlpool of uncomfortable sprinklings; when gutters brawled and\\nwaterspouts were full and noisy; when the wet from the projecting stones\\nand ledges of the church fell drip, drip, drip, on Toby, making the wisp\\nof straw on which he stood mere mud in no time; those were the days that\\ntried him.', 'Then, indeed, you might see Toby looking anxiously out from\\nhis shelter in an angle of the church wall—such a meagre shelter that in\\nsummer time it never cast a shadow thicker than a good-sized walking\\nstick upon the sunny pavement—with a disconsolate and lengthened face.', 'But coming out, a minute afterwards, to warm himself by exercise, and\\ntrotting up and down some dozen times, he would brighten even then, and\\ngo back more brightly to his niche.', 'They called him Trotty from his pace, which meant speed if it didn’t make\\nit.', 'He could have walked faster perhaps; most likely; but rob him of his\\ntrot, and Toby would have taken to his bed and died.', 'It bespattered him\\nwith mud in dirty weather; it cost him a world of trouble; he could have\\nwalked with infinitely greater ease; but that was one reason for his\\nclinging to it so tenaciously.', 'A weak, small, spare old man, he was a\\nvery Hercules, this Toby, in his good intentions.', 'He loved to earn his\\nmoney.', 'He delighted to believe—Toby was very poor, and couldn’t well\\nafford to part with a delight—that he was worth his salt.', 'With a\\nshilling or an eighteenpenny message or small parcel in hand, his courage\\nalways high, rose higher.', 'As he trotted on, he would call out to fast\\nPostmen ahead of him, to get out of the way; devoutly believing that in\\nthe natural course of things he must inevitably overtake and run them\\ndown; and he had perfect faith—not often tested—in his being able to\\ncarry anything that man could lift.', 'Thus, even when he came out of his nook to warm himself on a wet day,\\nToby trotted.', 'Making, with his leaky shoes, a crooked line of slushy\\nfootprints in the mire; and blowing on his chilly hands and rubbing them\\nagainst each other, poorly defended from the searching cold by threadbare\\nmufflers of grey worsted, with a private apartment only for the thumb,\\nand a common room or tap for the rest of the fingers; Toby, with his\\nknees bent and his cane beneath his arm, still trotted.', 'Falling out into\\nthe road to look up at the belfry when the Chimes resounded, Toby trotted\\nstill.', 'He made this last excursion several times a day, for they were company to\\nhim; and when he heard their voices, he had an interest in glancing at\\ntheir lodging-place, and thinking how they were moved, and what hammers\\nbeat upon them.', 'Perhaps he was the more curious about these Bells,\\nbecause there were points of resemblance between themselves and him.', 'They hung there, in all weathers, with the wind and rain driving in upon\\nthem; facing only the outsides of all those houses; never getting any\\nnearer to the blazing fires that gleamed and shone upon the windows, or\\ncame puffing out of the chimney tops; and incapable of participation in\\nany of the good things that were constantly being handed through the\\nstreet doors and the area railings, to prodigious cooks.', 'Faces came and\\nwent at many windows: sometimes pretty faces, youthful faces, pleasant\\nfaces: sometimes the reverse: but Toby knew no more (though he often\\nspeculated on these trifles, standing idle in the streets) whence they\\ncame, or where they went, or whether, when the lips moved, one kind word\\nwas said of him in all the year, than did the Chimes themselves.', 'Toby was not a casuist—that he knew of, at least—and I don’t mean to say\\nthat when he began to take to the Bells, and to knit up his first rough\\nacquaintance with them into something of a closer and more delicate woof,\\nhe passed through these considerations one by one, or held any formal\\nreview or great field-day in his thoughts.', 'But what I mean to say, and\\ndo say is, that as the functions of Toby’s body, his digestive organs for\\nexample, did of their own cunning, and by a great many operations of\\nwhich he was altogether ignorant, and the knowledge of which would have\\nastonished him very much, arrive at a certain end; so his mental\\nfaculties, without his privity or concurrence, set all these wheels and\\nsprings in motion, with a thousand others, when they worked to bring\\nabout his liking for the Bells.', 'And though I had said his love, I would not have recalled the word,\\nthough it would scarcely have expressed his complicated feeling.', 'For,\\nbeing but a simple man, he invested them with a strange and solemn\\ncharacter.', 'They were so mysterious, often heard and never seen; so high\\nup, so far off, so full of such a deep strong melody, that he regarded\\nthem with a species of awe; and sometimes when he looked up at the dark\\narched windows in the tower, he half expected to be beckoned to by\\nsomething which was not a Bell, and yet was what he had heard so often\\nsounding in the Chimes.', 'For all this, Toby scouted with indignation a\\ncertain flying rumour that the Chimes were haunted, as implying the\\npossibility of their being connected with any Evil thing.', 'In short, they\\nwere very often in his ears, and very often in his thoughts, but always\\nin his good opinion; and he very often got such a crick in his neck by\\nstaring with his mouth wide open, at the steeple where they hung, that he\\nwas fain to take an extra trot or two, afterwards, to cure it.', 'The very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day, when the last\\ndrowsy sound of Twelve o’clock, just struck, was humming like a melodious\\nmonster of a Bee, and not by any means a busy bee, all through the\\nsteeple!', '‘Dinner-time, eh!’ said Toby, trotting up and down before the church.', '‘Ah!’\\n\\nToby’s nose was very red, and his eyelids were very red, and he winked\\nvery much, and his shoulders were very near his ears, and his legs were\\nvery stiff, and altogether he was evidently a long way upon the frosty\\nside of cool.', '‘Dinner-time, eh!’ repeated Toby, using his right-hand muffler like an\\ninfantine boxing-glove, and punishing his chest for being cold.', '‘Ah-h-h-h!’\\n\\nHe took a silent trot, after that, for a minute or two.', '‘There’s nothing,’ said Toby, breaking forth afresh—but here he stopped\\nshort in his trot, and with a face of great interest and some alarm, felt\\nhis nose carefully all the way up.', 'It was but a little way (not being\\nmuch of a nose) and he had soon finished.', '‘I thought it was gone,’ said Toby, trotting off again.', '‘It’s all right,\\nhowever.', 'I am sure I couldn’t blame it if it was to go.', 'It has a\\nprecious hard service of it in the bitter weather, and precious little to\\nlook forward to; for I don’t take snuff myself.', 'It’s a good deal tried,\\npoor creetur, at the best of times; for when it _does_ get hold of a\\npleasant whiff or so (which an’t too often) it’s generally from somebody\\nelse’s dinner, a-coming home from the baker’s.’\\n\\nThe reflection reminded him of that other reflection, which he had left\\nunfinished.', '‘There’s nothing,’ said Toby, ‘more regular in its coming round than\\ndinner-time, and nothing less regular in its coming round than dinner.', 'That’s the great difference between ’em.', 'It’s took me a long time to\\nfind it out.', 'I wonder whether it would be worth any gentleman’s while,\\nnow, to buy that obserwation for the Papers; or the Parliament!’\\n\\nToby was only joking, for he gravely shook his head in self-depreciation.', '‘Why!', 'Lord!’ said Toby.', '‘The Papers is full of obserwations as it is;\\nand so’s the Parliament.', 'Here’s last week’s paper, now;’ taking a very\\ndirty one from his pocket, and holding it from him at arm’s length; ‘full\\nof obserwations!', 'Full of obserwations!', 'I like to know the news as well\\nas any man,’ said Toby, slowly; folding it a little smaller, and putting\\nit in his pocket again: ‘but it almost goes against the grain with me to\\nread a paper now.', 'It frightens me almost.', 'I don’t know what we poor\\npeople are coming to.', 'Lord send we may be coming to something better in\\nthe New Year nigh upon us!’\\n\\n‘Why, father, father!’ said a pleasant voice, hard by.', 'But Toby, not hearing it, continued to trot backwards and forwards:\\nmusing as he went, and talking to himself.', '‘It seems as if we can’t go right, or do right, or be righted,’ said\\nToby.', '‘I hadn’t much schooling, myself, when I was young; and I can’t\\nmake out whether we have any business on the face of the earth, or not.', 'Sometimes I think we must have—a little; and sometimes I think we must be\\nintruding.', 'I get so puzzled sometimes that I am not even able to make up\\nmy mind whether there is any good at all in us, or whether we are born\\nbad.', 'We seem to be dreadful things; we seem to give a deal of trouble;\\nwe are always being complained of and guarded against.', 'One way or other,\\nwe fill the papers.', 'Talk of a New Year!’ said Toby, mournfully.', '‘I can\\nbear up as well as another man at most times; better than a good many,\\nfor I am as strong as a lion, and all men an’t; but supposing it should\\nreally be that we have no right to a New Year—supposing we really _are_\\nintruding—’\\n\\n‘Why, father, father!’ said the pleasant voice again.', 'Toby heard it this time; started; stopped; and shortening his sight,\\nwhich had been directed a long way off as seeking the enlightenment in\\nthe very heart of the approaching year, found himself face to face with\\nhis own child, and looking close into her eyes.', 'Bright eyes they were.', 'Eyes that would bear a world of looking in,\\nbefore their depth was fathomed.', 'Dark eyes, that reflected back the eyes\\nwhich searched them; not flashingly, or at the owner’s will, but with a\\nclear, calm, honest, patient radiance, claiming kindred with that light\\nwhich Heaven called into being.', 'Eyes that were beautiful and true, and\\nbeaming with Hope.', 'With Hope so young and fresh; with Hope so buoyant,\\nvigorous, and bright, despite the twenty years of work and poverty on\\nwhich they had looked; that they became a voice to Trotty Veck, and said:\\n‘I think we have some business here—a little!’\\n\\nTrotty kissed the lips belonging to the eyes, and squeezed the blooming\\nface between his hands.', '‘Why, Pet,’ said Trotty.', '‘What’s to do?', 'I didn’t expect you to-day,\\nMeg.’\\n\\n‘Neither did I expect to come, father,’ cried the girl, nodding her head\\nand smiling as she spoke.', '‘But here I am!', 'And not alone; not alone!’\\n\\n‘Why you don’t mean to say,’ observed Trotty, looking curiously at a\\ncovered basket which she carried in her hand, ‘that you—’\\n\\n‘Smell it, father dear,’ said Meg.', '‘Only smell it!’\\n\\nTrotty was going to lift up the cover at once, in a great hurry, when she\\ngaily interposed her hand.', '‘No, no, no,’ said Meg, with the glee of a child.', '‘Lengthen it out a\\nlittle.', 'Let me just lift up the corner; just the lit-tle ti-ny cor-ner,\\nyou know,’ said Meg, suiting the action to the word with the utmost\\ngentleness, and speaking very softly, as if she were afraid of being\\noverheard by something inside the basket; ‘there.', 'Now.', 'What’s that?’\\n\\nToby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket, and\\ncried out in a rapture:\\n\\n‘Why, it’s hot!’\\n\\n‘It’s burning hot!’ cried Meg.', '‘Ha, ha, ha!', 'It’s scalding hot!’\\n\\n‘Ha, ha, ha!’ roared Toby, with a sort of kick.', '‘It’s scalding hot!’\\n\\n‘But what is it, father?’ said Meg.', '‘Come.', 'You haven’t guessed what it\\nis.', 'And you must guess what it is.', 'I can’t think of taking it out, till\\nyou guess what it is.', 'Don’t be in such a hurry!', 'Wait a minute!', 'A\\nlittle bit more of the cover.', 'Now guess!’\\n\\nMeg was in a perfect fright lest he should guess right too soon;\\nshrinking away, as she held the basket towards him; curling up her pretty\\nshoulders; stopping her ear with her hand, as if by so doing she could\\nkeep the right word out of Toby’s lips; and laughing softly the whole\\ntime.', 'Meanwhile Toby, putting a hand on each knee, bent down his nose to the\\nbasket, and took a long inspiration at the lid; the grin upon his\\nwithered face expanding in the process, as if he were inhaling laughing\\ngas.', '‘Ah!', 'It’s very nice,’ said Toby.', '‘It an’t—I suppose it an’t Polonies?’\\n\\n‘No, no, no!’ cried Meg, delighted.', '‘Nothing like Polonies!’\\n\\n‘No,’ said Toby, after another sniff.', '‘It’s—it’s mellower than Polonies.', 'It’s very nice.', 'It improves every moment.', 'It’s too decided for\\nTrotters.', 'An’t it?’\\n\\nMeg was in an ecstasy.', 'He could not have gone wider of the mark than\\nTrotters—except Polonies.', '‘Liver?’ said Toby, communing with himself.', '‘No.', 'There’s a mildness\\nabout it that don’t answer to liver.', 'Pettitoes?', 'No.', 'It an’t faint\\nenough for pettitoes.', 'It wants the stringiness of Cocks’ heads.', 'And I\\nknow it an’t sausages.', 'I’ll tell you what it is.', 'It’s chitterlings!’\\n\\n‘No, it an’t!’ cried Meg, in a burst of delight.', '‘No, it an’t!’\\n\\n‘Why, what am I a-thinking of!’ said Toby, suddenly recovering a position\\nas near the perpendicular as it was possible for him to assume.', '‘I shall\\nforget my own name next.', 'It’s tripe!’\\n\\nTripe it was; and Meg, in high joy, protested he should say, in half a\\nminute more, it was the best tripe ever stewed.', '‘And so,’ said Meg, busying herself exultingly with the basket, ‘I’ll lay\\nthe cloth at once, father; for I have brought the tripe in a basin, and\\ntied the basin up in a pocket-handkerchief; and if I like to be proud for\\nonce, and spread that for a cloth, and call it a cloth, there’s no law to\\nprevent me; is there, father?’\\n\\n‘Not that I know of, my dear,’ said Toby.', '‘But they’re always a-bringing\\nup some new law or other.’\\n\\n‘And according to what I was reading you in the paper the other day,\\nfather; what the Judge said, you know; we poor people are supposed to\\nknow them all.', 'Ha ha!', 'What a mistake!', 'My goodness me, how clever they\\nthink us!’\\n\\n‘Yes, my dear,’ cried Trotty; ‘and they’d be very fond of any one of us\\nthat _did_ know ’em all.', 'He’d grow fat upon the work he’d get, that man,\\nand be popular with the gentlefolks in his neighbourhood.', 'Very much so!’\\n\\n‘He’d eat his dinner with an appetite, whoever he was, if it smelt like\\nthis,’ said Meg, cheerfully.', '‘Make haste, for there’s a hot potato\\nbesides, and half a pint of fresh-drawn beer in a bottle.', 'Where will you\\ndine, father?', 'On the Post, or on the Steps?', 'Dear, dear, how grand we\\nare.', 'Two places to choose from!’\\n\\n‘The steps to-day, my Pet,’ said Trotty.', '‘Steps in dry weather.', 'Post in\\nwet.', 'There’s a greater conveniency in the steps at all times, because of\\nthe sitting down; but they’re rheumatic in the damp.’\\n\\n‘Then here,’ said Meg, clapping her hands, after a moment’s bustle; ‘here\\nit is, all ready!', 'And beautiful it looks!', 'Come, father.', 'Come!’\\n\\nSince his discovery of the contents of the basket, Trotty had been\\nstanding looking at her—and had been speaking too—in an abstracted\\nmanner, which showed that though she was the object of his thoughts and\\neyes, to the exclusion even of tripe, he neither saw nor thought about\\nher as she was at that moment, but had before him some imaginary rough\\nsketch or drama of her future life.', 'Roused, now, by her cheerful\\nsummons, he shook off a melancholy shake of the head which was just\\ncoming upon him, and trotted to her side.', 'As he was stooping to sit\\ndown, the Chimes rang.', '‘Amen!’ said Trotty, pulling off his hat and looking up towards them.', '‘Amen to the Bells, father?’ cried Meg.', '‘They broke in like a grace, my dear,’ said Trotty, taking his seat.', '‘They’d say a good one, I am sure, if they could.', 'Many’s the kind thing\\nthey say to me.’\\n\\n‘The Bells do, father!’ laughed Meg, as she set the basin, and a knife\\nand fork, before him.', '‘Well!’\\n\\n‘Seem to, my Pet,’ said Trotty, falling to with great vigour.', '‘And\\nwhere’s the difference?', 'If I hear ’em, what does it matter whether they\\nspeak it or not?', 'Why bless you, my dear,’ said Toby, pointing at the\\ntower with his fork, and becoming more animated under the influence of\\ndinner, ‘how often have I heard them bells say, “Toby Veck, Toby Veck,\\nkeep a good heart, Toby!', 'Toby Veck, Toby Veck, keep a good heart, Toby!”\\nA million times?', 'More!’\\n\\n‘Well, I never!’ cried Meg.', 'She had, though—over and over again.', 'For it was Toby’s constant topic.', '‘When things is very bad,’ said Trotty; ‘very bad indeed, I mean; almost\\nat the worst; then it’s “Toby Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon, Toby!', 'Toby Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon, Toby!”  That way.’\\n\\n‘And it comes—at last, father,’ said Meg, with a touch of sadness in her\\npleasant voice.', '‘Always,’ answered the unconscious Toby.', '‘Never fails.’\\n\\nWhile this discourse was holding, Trotty made no pause in his attack upon\\nthe savoury meat before him, but cut and ate, and cut and drank, and cut\\nand chewed, and dodged about, from tripe to hot potato, and from hot\\npotato back again to tripe, with an unctuous and unflagging relish.', 'But\\nhappening now to look all round the street—in case anybody should be\\nbeckoning from any door or window, for a porter—his eyes, in coming back\\nagain, encountered Meg: sitting opposite to him, with her arms folded and\\nonly busy in watching his progress with a smile of happiness.', '‘Why, Lord forgive me!’ said Trotty, dropping his knife and fork.', '‘My\\ndove!', 'Meg!', 'why didn’t you tell me what a beast I was?’\\n\\n‘Father?’\\n\\n‘Sitting here,’ said Trotty, in penitent explanation, ‘cramming, and\\nstuffing, and gorging myself; and you before me there, never so much as\\nbreaking your precious fast, nor wanting to, when—’\\n\\n‘But I have broken it, father,’ interposed his daughter, laughing, ‘all\\nto bits.', 'I have had my dinner.’\\n\\n‘Nonsense,’ said Trotty.', '‘Two dinners in one day!', 'It an’t possible!', 'You might as well tell me that two New Year’s Days will come together, or\\nthat I have had a gold head all my life, and never changed it.’\\n\\n‘I have had my dinner, father, for all that,’ said Meg, coming nearer to\\nhim.', '‘And if you’ll go on with yours, I’ll tell you how and where; and\\nhow your dinner came to be brought; and—and something else besides.’\\n\\nToby still appeared incredulous; but she looked into his face with her\\nclear eyes, and laying her hand upon his shoulder, motioned him to go on\\nwhile the meat was hot.', 'So Trotty took up his knife and fork again, and\\nwent to work.', 'But much more slowly than before, and shaking his head, as\\nif he were not at all pleased with himself.', '‘I had my dinner, father,’ said Meg, after a little hesitation,\\n‘with—with Richard.', 'His dinner-time was early; and as he brought his\\ndinner with him when he came to see me, we—we had it together, father.’\\n\\nTrotty took a little beer, and smacked his lips.', 'Then he said,\\n‘Oh!’—because she waited.', '‘And Richard says, father—’ Meg resumed.', 'Then stopped.', '‘What does Richard say, Meg?’ asked Toby.', '‘Richard says, father—’  Another stoppage.', '‘Richard’s a long time saying it,’ said Toby.', '‘He says then, father,’ Meg continued, lifting up her eyes at last, and\\nspeaking in a tremble, but quite plainly; ‘another year is nearly gone,\\nand where is the use of waiting on from year to year, when it is so\\nunlikely we shall ever be better off than we are now?', 'He says we are\\npoor now, father, and we shall be poor then, but we are young now, and\\nyears will make us old before we know it.', 'He says that if we wait:\\npeople in our condition: until we see our way quite clearly, the way will\\nbe a narrow one indeed—the common way—the Grave, father.’\\n\\nA bolder man than Trotty Veck must needs have drawn upon his boldness\\nlargely, to deny it.', 'Trotty held his peace.', '‘And how hard, father, to grow old, and die, and think we might have\\ncheered and helped each other!', 'How hard in all our lives to love each\\nother; and to grieve, apart, to see each other working, changing, growing\\nold and grey.', 'Even if I got the better of it, and forgot him (which I\\nnever could), oh father dear, how hard to have a heart so full as mine is\\nnow, and live to have it slowly drained out every drop, without the\\nrecollection of one happy moment of a woman’s life, to stay behind and\\ncomfort me, and make me better!’\\n\\nTrotty sat quite still.', 'Meg dried her eyes, and said more gaily: that is\\nto say, with here a laugh, and there a sob, and here a laugh and sob\\ntogether:\\n\\n‘So Richard says, father; as his work was yesterday made certain for some\\ntime to come, and as I love him, and have loved him full three years—ah!', 'longer than that, if he knew it!—will I marry him on New Year’s Day; the\\nbest and happiest day, he says, in the whole year, and one that is almost\\nsure to bring good fortune with it.', 'It’s a short notice, father—isn’t\\nit?—but I haven’t my fortune to be settled, or my wedding dresses to be\\nmade, like the great ladies, father, have I?', 'And he said so much, and\\nsaid it in his way; so strong and earnest, and all the time so kind and\\ngentle; that I said I’d come and talk to you, father.', 'And as they paid\\nthe money for that work of mine this morning (unexpectedly, I am sure!)', 'and as you have fared very poorly for a whole week, and as I couldn’t\\nhelp wishing there should be something to make this day a sort of holiday\\nto you as well as a dear and happy day to me, father, I made a little\\ntreat and brought it to surprise you.’\\n\\n‘And see how he leaves it cooling on the step!’ said another voice.', 'It was the voice of this same Richard, who had come upon them unobserved,\\nand stood before the father and daughter; looking down upon them with a\\nface as glowing as the iron on which his stout sledge-hammer daily rung.', 'A handsome, well-made, powerful youngster he was; with eyes that sparkled\\nlike the red-hot droppings from a furnace fire; black hair that curled\\nabout his swarthy temples rarely; and a smile—a smile that bore out Meg’s\\neulogium on his style of conversation.', '‘See how he leaves it cooling on the step!’ said Richard.', '‘Meg don’t\\nknow what he likes.', 'Not she!’\\n\\nTrotty, all action and enthusiasm, immediately reached up his hand to\\nRichard, and was going to address him in great hurry, when the house-door\\nopened without any warning, and a footman very nearly put his foot into\\nthe tripe.', '‘Out of the vays here, will you!', 'You must always go and be a-settin on\\nour steps, must you!', 'You can’t go and give a turn to none of the\\nneighbours never, can’t you!', '_Will_ you clear the road, or won’t you?’\\n\\nStrictly speaking, the last question was irrelevant, as they had already\\ndone it.', '‘What’s the matter, what’s the matter!’ said the gentleman for whom the\\ndoor was opened; coming out of the house at that kind of light-heavy\\npace—that peculiar compromise between a walk and a jog-trot—with which a\\ngentleman upon the smooth down-hill of life, wearing creaking boots, a\\nwatch-chain, and clean linen, _may_ come out of his house: not only\\nwithout any abatement of his dignity, but with an expression of having\\nimportant and wealthy engagements elsewhere.', '‘What’s the matter!', 'What’s\\nthe matter!’\\n\\n‘You’re always a-being begged, and prayed, upon your bended knees you\\nare,’ said the footman with great emphasis to Trotty Veck, ‘to let our\\ndoor-steps be.', 'Why don’t you let ’em be?', 'CAN’T you let ’em be?’\\n\\n‘There!', 'That’ll do, that’ll do!’ said the gentleman.', '‘Halloa there!', 'Porter!’ beckoning with his head to Trotty Veck.', '‘Come here.', 'What’s\\nthat?', 'Your dinner?’\\n\\n‘Yes, sir,’ said Trotty, leaving it behind him in a corner.', '‘Don’t leave it there,’ exclaimed the gentleman.', '‘Bring it here, bring\\nit here.', 'So!', 'This is your dinner, is it?’\\n\\n‘Yes, sir,’ repeated Trotty, looking with a fixed eye and a watery mouth,\\nat the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last delicious tit-bit; which\\nthe gentleman was now turning over and over on the end of the fork.', 'Two other gentlemen had come out with him.', 'One was a low-spirited\\ngentleman of middle age, of a meagre habit, and a disconsolate face; who\\nkept his hands continually in the pockets of his scanty pepper-and-salt\\ntrousers, very large and dog’s-eared from that custom; and was not\\nparticularly well brushed or washed.', 'The other, a full-sized, sleek,\\nwell-conditioned gentleman, in a blue coat with bright buttons, and a\\nwhite cravat.', 'This gentleman had a very red face, as if an undue\\nproportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up into his head; which\\nperhaps accounted for his having also the appearance of being rather cold\\nabout the heart.', 'He who had Toby’s meat upon the fork, called to the first one by the name\\nof Filer; and they both drew near together.', 'Mr. Filer being exceedingly\\nshort-sighted, was obliged to go so close to the remnant of Toby’s dinner\\nbefore he could make out what it was, that Toby’s heart leaped up into\\nhis mouth.', 'But Mr. Filer didn’t eat it.', '‘This is a description of animal food, Alderman,’ said Filer, making\\nlittle punches in it with a pencil-case, ‘commonly known to the labouring\\npopulation of this country, by the name of tripe.’\\n\\nThe Alderman laughed, and winked; for he was a merry fellow, Alderman\\nCute.', 'Oh, and a sly fellow too!', 'A knowing fellow.', 'Up to everything.', 'Not to be imposed upon.', 'Deep in the people’s hearts!', 'He knew them, Cute\\ndid.', 'I believe you!', '‘But who eats tripe?’ said Mr. Filer, looking round.', '‘Tripe is without\\nan exception the least economical, and the most wasteful article of\\nconsumption that the markets of this country can by possibility produce.', 'The loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be, in the boiling,\\nseven-eights of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other\\nanimal substance whatever.', 'Tripe is more expensive, properly understood,\\nthan the hothouse pine-apple.', 'Taking into account the number of animals\\nslaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone; and forming a low\\nestimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of those animals,\\nreasonably well butchered, would yield; I find that the waste on that\\namount of tripe, if boiled, would victual a garrison of five hundred men\\nfor five months of thirty-one days each, and a February over.', 'The Waste,\\nthe Waste!’\\n\\nTrotty stood aghast, and his legs shook under him.', 'He seemed to have\\nstarved a garrison of five hundred men with his own hand.', '‘Who eats tripe?’ said Mr. Filer, warmly.', '‘Who eats tripe?’\\n\\nTrotty made a miserable bow.', '‘You do, do you?’ said Mr. Filer.', '‘Then I’ll tell you something.', 'You\\nsnatch your tripe, my friend, out of the mouths of widows and orphans.’\\n\\n‘I hope not, sir,’ said Trotty, faintly.', '‘I’d sooner die of want!’\\n\\n‘Divide the amount of tripe before-mentioned, Alderman,’ said Mr. Filer,\\n‘by the estimated number of existing widows and orphans, and the result\\nwill be one pennyweight of tripe to each.', 'Not a grain is left for that\\nman.', 'Consequently, he’s a robber.’\\n\\nTrotty was so shocked, that it gave him no concern to see the Alderman\\nfinish the tripe himself.', 'It was a relief to get rid of it, anyhow.', '‘And what do you say?’ asked the Alderman, jocosely, of the red-faced\\ngentleman in the blue coat.', '‘You have heard friend Filer.', 'What do _you\\nsay_?’\\n\\n‘What’s it possible to say?’ returned the gentleman.', '‘What _is_ to be\\nsaid?', 'Who can take any interest in a fellow like this,’ meaning Trotty;\\n‘in such degenerate times as these?', 'Look at him.', 'What an object!', 'The\\ngood old times, the grand old times, the great old times!', '_Those_ were\\nthe times for a bold peasantry, and all that sort of thing.', 'Those were\\nthe times for every sort of thing, in fact.', 'There’s nothing now-a-days.', 'Ah!’ sighed the red-faced gentleman.', '‘The good old times, the good old\\ntimes!’\\n\\nThe gentleman didn’t specify what particular times he alluded to; nor did\\nhe say whether he objected to the present times, from a disinterested\\nconsciousness that they had done nothing very remarkable in producing\\nhimself.', '‘The good old times, the good old times,’ repeated the gentleman.', '‘What\\ntimes they were!', 'They were the only times.', 'It’s of no use talking about\\nany other times, or discussing what the people are in _these_ times.', 'You\\ndon’t call these, times, do you?', 'I don’t.', 'Look into Strutt’s Costumes,\\nand see what a Porter used to be, in any of the good old English reigns.’\\n\\n‘He hadn’t, in his very best circumstances, a shirt to his back, or a\\nstocking to his foot; and there was scarcely a vegetable in all England\\nfor him to put into his mouth,’ said Mr. Filer.', '‘I can prove it, by\\ntables.’\\n\\nBut still the red-faced gentleman extolled the good old times, the grand\\nold times, the great old times.', 'No matter what anybody else said, he\\nstill went turning round and round in one set form of words concerning\\nthem; as a poor squirrel turns and turns in its revolving cage; touching\\nthe mechanism, and trick of which, it has probably quite as distinct\\nperceptions, as ever this red-faced gentleman had of his deceased\\nMillennium.', 'It is possible that poor Trotty’s faith in these very vague Old Times was\\nnot entirely destroyed, for he felt vague enough at that moment.', 'One\\nthing, however, was plain to him, in the midst of his distress; to wit,\\nthat however these gentlemen might differ in details, his misgivings of\\nthat morning, and of many other mornings, were well founded.', '‘No, no.', 'We can’t go right or do right,’ thought Trotty in despair.', '‘There is no\\ngood in us.', 'We are born bad!’\\n\\nBut Trotty had a father’s heart within him; which had somehow got into\\nhis breast in spite of this decree; and he could not bear that Meg, in\\nthe blush of her brief joy, should have her fortune read by these wise\\ngentlemen.', '‘God help her,’ thought poor Trotty.', '‘She will know it soon\\nenough.’\\n\\nHe anxiously signed, therefore, to the young smith, to take her away.', 'But he was so busy, talking to her softly at a little distance, that he\\nonly became conscious of this desire, simultaneously with Alderman Cute.', 'Now, the Alderman had not yet had his say, but _he_ was a philosopher,\\ntoo—practical, though!', 'Oh, very practical—and, as he had no idea of\\nlosing any portion of his audience, he cried ‘Stop!’\\n\\n‘Now, you know,’ said the Alderman, addressing his two friends, with a\\nself-complacent smile upon his face which was habitual to him, ‘I am a\\nplain man, and a practical man; and I go to work in a plain practical\\nway.', 'That’s my way.', 'There is not the least mystery or difficulty in\\ndealing with this sort of people if you only understand ’em, and can talk\\nto ’em in their own manner.', 'Now, you Porter!', 'Don’t you ever tell me, or\\nanybody else, my friend, that you haven’t always enough to eat, and of\\nthe best; because I know better.', 'I have tasted your tripe, you know, and\\nyou can’t “chaff” me.', 'You understand what “chaff” means, eh?', 'That’s the\\nright word, isn’t it?', 'Ha, ha, ha!', 'Lord bless you,’ said the Alderman,\\nturning to his friends again, ‘it’s the easiest thing on earth to deal\\nwith this sort of people, if you understand ’em.’\\n\\nFamous man for the common people, Alderman Cute!', 'Never out of temper\\nwith them!', 'Easy, affable, joking, knowing gentleman!', '‘You see, my friend,’ pursued the Alderman, ‘there’s a great deal of\\nnonsense talked about Want—“hard up,” you know; that’s the phrase, isn’t\\nit?', 'ha!', 'ha!', 'ha!—and I intend to Put it Down.', 'There’s a certain amount of\\ncant in vogue about Starvation, and I mean to Put it Down.', 'That’s all!', 'Lord bless you,’ said the Alderman, turning to his friends again, ‘you\\nmay Put Down anything among this sort of people, if you only know the way\\nto set about it.’\\n\\nTrotty took Meg’s hand and drew it through his arm.', 'He didn’t seem to\\nknow what he was doing though.', '‘Your daughter, eh?’ said the Alderman, chucking her familiarly under the\\nchin.', 'Always affable with the working classes, Alderman Cute!', 'Knew what\\npleased them!', 'Not a bit of pride!', '‘Where’s her mother?’ asked that worthy gentleman.', '‘Dead,’ said Toby.', '‘Her mother got up linen; and was called to Heaven\\nwhen She was born.’\\n\\n‘Not to get up linen _there_, I suppose,’ remarked the Alderman\\npleasantly.', 'Toby might or might not have been able to separate his wife in Heaven\\nfrom her old pursuits.', 'But query: If Mrs. Alderman Cute had gone to\\nHeaven, would Mr. Alderman Cute have pictured her as holding any state or\\nstation there?', '‘And you’re making love to her, are you?’ said Cute to the young smith.', '‘Yes,’ returned Richard quickly, for he was nettled by the question.', '‘And we are going to be married on New Year’s Day.’\\n\\n‘What do you mean!’ cried Filer sharply.', '‘Married!’\\n\\n‘Why, yes, we’re thinking of it, Master,’ said Richard.', '‘We’re rather in\\na hurry, you see, in case it should be Put Down first.’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ cried Filer, with a groan.', '‘Put _that_ down indeed, Alderman, and\\nyou’ll do something.', 'Married!', 'Married!!', 'The ignorance of the first\\nprinciples of political economy on the part of these people; their\\nimprovidence; their wickedness; is, by Heavens!', 'enough to—Now look at\\nthat couple, will you!’\\n\\nWell?', 'They were worth looking at.', 'And marriage seemed as reasonable and\\nfair a deed as they need have in contemplation.', '‘A man may live to be as old as Methuselah,’ said Mr. Filer, ‘and may\\nlabour all his life for the benefit of such people as those; and may heap\\nup facts on figures, facts on figures, facts on figures, mountains high\\nand dry; and he can no more hope to persuade ’em that they have no right\\nor business to be married, than he can hope to persuade ’em that they\\nhave no earthly right or business to be born.', 'And _that_ we know they\\nhaven’t.', 'We reduced it to a mathematical certainty long ago!’\\n\\nAlderman Cute was mightily diverted, and laid his right forefinger on the\\nside of his nose, as much as to say to both his friends, ‘Observe me,\\nwill you!', 'Keep your eye on the practical man!’—and called Meg to him.', '‘Come here, my girl!’ said Alderman Cute.', 'The young blood of her lover had been mounting, wrathfully, within the\\nlast few minutes; and he was indisposed to let her come.', 'But, setting a\\nconstraint upon himself, he came forward with a stride as Meg approached,\\nand stood beside her.', 'Trotty kept her hand within his arm still, but\\nlooked from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a dream.', '‘Now, I’m going to give you a word or two of good advice, my girl,’ said\\nthe Alderman, in his nice easy way.', '‘It’s my place to give advice, you\\nknow, because I’m a Justice.', 'You know I’m a Justice, don’t you?’\\n\\nMeg timidly said, ‘Yes.’  But everybody knew Alderman Cute was a Justice!', 'Oh dear, so active a Justice always!', 'Who such a mote of brightness in\\nthe public eye, as Cute!', '‘You are going to be married, you say,’ pursued the Alderman.', '‘Very\\nunbecoming and indelicate in one of your sex!', 'But never mind that.', 'After you are married, you’ll quarrel with your husband and come to be a\\ndistressed wife.', 'You may think not; but you will, because I tell you so.', 'Now, I give you fair warning, that I have made up my mind to Put\\ndistressed wives Down.', 'So, don’t be brought before me.', 'You’ll have\\nchildren—boys.', 'Those boys will grow up bad, of course, and run wild in\\nthe streets, without shoes and stockings.', 'Mind, my young friend!', 'I’ll\\nconvict ’em summarily, every one, for I am determined to Put boys without\\nshoes and stockings, Down.', 'Perhaps your husband will die young (most\\nlikely) and leave you with a baby.', 'Then you’ll be turned out of doors,\\nand wander up and down the streets.', 'Now, don’t wander near me, my dear,\\nfor I am resolved, to Put all wandering mothers Down.', 'All young mothers,\\nof all sorts and kinds, it’s my determination to Put Down.', 'Don’t think\\nto plead illness as an excuse with me; or babies as an excuse with me;\\nfor all sick persons and young children (I hope you know the\\nchurch-service, but I’m afraid not) I am determined to Put Down.', 'And if\\nyou attempt, desperately, and ungratefully, and impiously, and\\nfraudulently attempt, to drown yourself, or hang yourself, I’ll have no\\npity for you, for I have made up my mind to Put all suicide Down!', 'If\\nthere is one thing,’ said the Alderman, with his self-satisfied smile,\\n‘on which I can be said to have made up my mind more than on another, it\\nis to Put suicide Down.', 'So don’t try it on.', 'That’s the phrase, isn’t\\nit?', 'Ha, ha!', 'now we understand each other.’\\n\\nToby knew not whether to be agonised or glad, to see that Meg had turned\\na deadly white, and dropped her lover’s hand.', '‘And as for you, you dull dog,’ said the Alderman, turning with even\\nincreased cheerfulness and urbanity to the young smith, ‘what are you\\nthinking of being married for?', 'What do you want to be married for, you\\nsilly fellow?', 'If I was a fine, young, strapping chap like you, I should\\nbe ashamed of being milksop enough to pin myself to a woman’s\\napron-strings!', 'Why, she’ll be an old woman before you’re a middle-aged\\nman!', 'And a pretty figure you’ll cut then, with a draggle-tailed wife and\\na crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you go!’\\n\\nO, he knew how to banter the common people, Alderman Cute!', '‘There!', 'Go along with you,’ said the Alderman, ‘and repent.', 'Don’t make\\nsuch a fool of yourself as to get married on New Year’s Day.', 'You’ll\\nthink very differently of it, long before next New Year’s Day: a trim\\nyoung fellow like you, with all the girls looking after you.', 'There!', 'Go\\nalong with you!’\\n\\nThey went along.', 'Not arm in arm, or hand in hand, or interchanging\\nbright glances; but, she in tears; he, gloomy and down-looking.', 'Were\\nthese the hearts that had so lately made old Toby’s leap up from its\\nfaintness?', 'No, no.', 'The Alderman (a blessing on his head!)', 'had Put\\n_them_ Down.', '‘As you happen to be here,’ said the Alderman to Toby, ‘you shall carry a\\nletter for me.', 'Can you be quick?', 'You’re an old man.’\\n\\nToby, who had been looking after Meg, quite stupidly, made shift to\\nmurmur out that he was very quick, and very strong.', '‘How old are you?’ inquired the Alderman.', '‘I’m over sixty, sir,’ said Toby.', '‘O!', 'This man’s a great deal past the average age, you know,’ cried Mr.\\nFiler breaking in as if his patience would bear some trying, but this\\nreally was carrying matters a little too far.', '‘I feel I’m intruding, sir,’ said Toby.', '‘I—I misdoubted it this morning.', 'Oh dear me!’\\n\\nThe Alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his pocket.', 'Toby would have got a shilling too; but Mr. Filer clearly showing that in\\nthat case he would rob a certain given number of persons of\\nninepence-halfpenny a-piece, he only got sixpence; and thought himself\\nvery well off to get that.', 'Then the Alderman gave an arm to each of his friends, and walked off in\\nhigh feather; but, he immediately came hurrying back alone, as if he had\\nforgotten something.', '‘Porter!’ said the Alderman.', '‘Sir!’ said Toby.', '‘Take care of that daughter of yours.', 'She’s much too handsome.’\\n\\n‘Even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other, I suppose,’\\nthought Toby, looking at the sixpence in his hand, and thinking of the\\ntripe.', '‘She’s been and robbed five hundred ladies of a bloom a-piece, I\\nshouldn’t wonder.', 'It’s very dreadful!’\\n\\n‘She’s much too handsome, my man,’ repeated the Alderman.', '‘The chances\\nare, that she’ll come to no good, I clearly see.', 'Observe what I say.', 'Take care of her!’  With which, he hurried off again.', '‘Wrong every way.', 'Wrong every way!’ said Trotty, clasping his hands.', '‘Born bad.', 'No business here!’\\n\\nThe Chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the words.', 'Full, loud,\\nand sounding—but with no encouragement.', 'No, not a drop.', '‘The tune’s changed,’ cried the old man, as he listened.', '‘There’s not a\\nword of all that fancy in it.', 'Why should there be?', 'I have no business\\nwith the New Year nor with the old one neither.', 'Let me die!’\\n\\nStill the Bells, pealing forth their changes, made the very air spin.', 'Put ’em down, Put ’em down!', 'Good old Times, Good old Times!', 'Facts and\\nFigures, Facts and Figures!', 'Put ’em down, Put ’em down!', 'If they said\\nanything they said this, until the brain of Toby reeled.', 'He pressed his bewildered head between his hands, as if to keep it from\\nsplitting asunder.', 'A well-timed action, as it happened; for finding the\\nletter in one of them, and being by that means reminded of his charge, he\\nfell, mechanically, into his usual trot, and trotted off.', 'CHAPTER II—The Second Quarter.', 'The letter Toby had received from Alderman Cute, was addressed to a great\\nman in the great district of the town.', 'The greatest district of the\\ntown.', 'It must have been the greatest district of the town, because it\\nwas commonly called ‘the world’ by its inhabitants.', 'The letter\\npositively seemed heavier in Toby’s hand, than another letter.', 'Not\\nbecause the Alderman had sealed it with a very large coat of arms and no\\nend of wax, but because of the weighty name on the superscription, and\\nthe ponderous amount of gold and silver with which it was associated.', '‘How different from us!’ thought Toby, in all simplicity and earnestness,\\nas he looked at the direction.', '‘Divide the lively turtles in the bills\\nof mortality, by the number of gentlefolks able to buy ’em; and whose\\nshare does he take but his own!', 'As to snatching tripe from anybody’s\\nmouth—he’d scorn it!’\\n\\nWith the involuntary homage due to such an exalted character, Toby\\ninterposed a corner of his apron between the letter and his fingers.', '‘His children,’ said Trotty, and a mist rose before his eyes; ‘his\\ndaughters—Gentlemen may win their hearts and marry them; they may be\\nhappy wives and mothers; they may be handsome like my darling M-e-’.', 'He couldn’t finish the name.', 'The final letter swelled in his throat, to\\nthe size of the whole alphabet.', '‘Never mind,’ thought Trotty.', '‘I know what I mean.', 'That’s more than\\nenough for me.’  And with this consolatory rumination, trotted on.', 'It was a hard frost, that day.', 'The air was bracing, crisp, and clear.', 'The wintry sun, though powerless for warmth, looked brightly down upon\\nthe ice it was too weak to melt, and set a radiant glory there.', 'At other\\ntimes, Trotty might have learned a poor man’s lesson from the wintry sun;\\nbut, he was past that, now.', 'The Year was Old, that day.', 'The patient Year had lived through the\\nreproaches and misuses of its slanderers, and faithfully performed its\\nwork.', 'Spring, summer, autumn, winter.', 'It had laboured through the\\ndestined round, and now laid down its weary head to die.', 'Shut out from\\nhope, high impulse, active happiness, itself, but active messenger of\\nmany joys to others, it made appeal in its decline to have its toiling\\ndays and patient hours remembered, and to die in peace.', 'Trotty might\\nhave read a poor man’s allegory in the fading year; but he was past that,\\nnow.', 'And only he?', 'Or has the like appeal been ever made, by seventy years at\\nonce upon an English labourer’s head, and made in vain!', 'The streets were full of motion, and the shops were decked out gaily.', 'The New Year, like an Infant Heir to the whole world, was waited for,\\nwith welcomes, presents, and rejoicings.', 'There were books and toys for\\nthe New Year, glittering trinkets for the New Year, dresses for the New\\nYear, schemes of fortune for the New Year; new inventions to beguile it.', 'Its life was parcelled out in almanacks and pocket-books; the coming of\\nits moons, and stars, and tides, was known beforehand to the moment; all\\nthe workings of its seasons in their days and nights, were calculated\\nwith as much precision as Mr. Filer could work sums in men and women.', 'The New Year, the New Year.', 'Everywhere the New Year!', 'The Old Year was\\nalready looked upon as dead; and its effects were selling cheap, like\\nsome drowned mariner’s aboardship.', 'Its patterns were Last Year’s, and\\ngoing at a sacrifice, before its breath was gone.', 'Its treasures were\\nmere dirt, beside the riches of its unborn successor!', 'Trotty had no portion, to his thinking, in the New Year or the Old.', '‘Put ’em down, Put ’em down!', 'Facts and Figures, Facts and Figures!', 'Good\\nold Times, Good old Times!', 'Put ’em down, Put ’em down!’—his trot went to\\nthat measure, and would fit itself to nothing else.', 'But, even that one, melancholy as it was, brought him, in due time, to\\nthe end of his journey.', 'To the mansion of Sir Joseph Bowley, Member of\\nParliament.', 'The door was opened by a Porter.', 'Such a Porter!', 'Not of Toby’s order.', 'Quite another thing.', 'His place was the ticket though; not Toby’s.', 'This Porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak; having\\nbreathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair, without first\\ntaking time to think about it and compose his mind.', 'When he had found\\nhis voice—which it took him a long time to do, for it was a long way off,\\nand hidden under a load of meat—he said in a fat whisper,\\n\\n‘Who’s it from?’\\n\\nToby told him.', '‘You’re to take it in, yourself,’ said the Porter, pointing to a room at\\nthe end of a long passage, opening from the hall.', '‘Everything goes\\nstraight in, on this day of the year.', 'You’re not a bit too soon; for the\\ncarriage is at the door now, and they have only come to town for a couple\\nof hours, a’ purpose.’\\n\\nToby wiped his feet (which were quite dry already) with great care, and\\ntook the way pointed out to him; observing as he went that it was an\\nawfully grand house, but hushed and covered up, as if the family were in\\nthe country.', 'Knocking at the room-door, he was told to enter from\\nwithin; and doing so found himself in a spacious library, where, at a\\ntable strewn with files and papers, were a stately lady in a bonnet; and\\na not very stately gentleman in black who wrote from her dictation; while\\nanother, and an older, and a much statelier gentleman, whose hat and cane\\nwere on the table, walked up and down, with one hand in his breast, and\\nlooked complacently from time to time at his own picture—a full length; a\\nvery full length—hanging over the fireplace.', '‘What is this?’ said the last-named gentleman.', '‘Mr.', 'Fish, will you have\\nthe goodness to attend?’\\n\\nMr.', 'Fish begged pardon, and taking the letter from Toby, handed it, with\\ngreat respect.', '‘From Alderman Cute, Sir Joseph.’\\n\\n‘Is this all?', 'Have you nothing else, Porter?’ inquired Sir Joseph.', 'Toby replied in the negative.', '‘You have no bill or demand upon me—my name is Bowley, Sir Joseph\\nBowley—of any kind from anybody, have you?’ said Sir Joseph.', '‘If you\\nhave, present it.', 'There is a cheque-book by the side of Mr.', 'Fish.', 'I\\nallow nothing to be carried into the New Year.', 'Every description of\\naccount is settled in this house at the close of the old one.', 'So that if\\ndeath was to—to—’\\n\\n‘To cut,’ suggested Mr.', 'Fish.', '‘To sever, sir,’ returned Sir Joseph, with great asperity, ‘the cord of\\nexistence—my affairs would be found, I hope, in a state of preparation.’\\n\\n‘My dear Sir Joseph!’ said the lady, who was greatly younger than the\\ngentleman.', '‘How shocking!’\\n\\n‘My lady Bowley,’ returned Sir Joseph, floundering now and then, as in\\nthe great depth of his observations, ‘at this season of the year we\\nshould think of—of—ourselves.', 'We should look into our—our accounts.', 'We\\nshould feel that every return of so eventful a period in human\\ntransactions, involves a matter of deep moment between a man and his—and\\nhis banker.’\\n\\nSir Joseph delivered these words as if he felt the full morality of what\\nhe was saying; and desired that even Trotty should have an opportunity of\\nbeing improved by such discourse.', 'Possibly he had this end before him in\\nstill forbearing to break the seal of the letter, and in telling Trotty\\nto wait where he was, a minute.', '‘You were desiring Mr.', 'Fish to say, my lady—’ observed Sir Joseph.', '‘Mr.', 'Fish has said that, I believe,’ returned his lady, glancing at the\\nletter.', '‘But, upon my word, Sir Joseph, I don’t think I can let it go\\nafter all.', 'It is so very dear.’\\n\\n‘What is dear?’ inquired Sir Joseph.', '‘That Charity, my love.', 'They only allow two votes for a subscription of\\nfive pounds.', 'Really monstrous!’\\n\\n‘My lady Bowley,’ returned Sir Joseph, ‘you surprise me.', 'Is the luxury\\nof feeling in proportion to the number of votes; or is it, to a rightly\\nconstituted mind, in proportion to the number of applicants, and the\\nwholesome state of mind to which their canvassing reduces them?', 'Is there\\nno excitement of the purest kind in having two votes to dispose of among\\nfifty people?’\\n\\n‘Not to me, I acknowledge,’ replied the lady.', '‘It bores one.', 'Besides,\\none can’t oblige one’s acquaintance.', 'But you are the Poor Man’s Friend,\\nyou know, Sir Joseph.', 'You think otherwise.’\\n\\n‘I _am_ the Poor Man’s Friend,’ observed Sir Joseph, glancing at the poor\\nman present.', '‘As such I may be taunted.', 'As such I have been taunted.', 'But I ask no other title.’\\n\\n‘Bless him for a noble gentleman!’ thought Trotty.', '‘I don’t agree with Cute here, for instance,’ said Sir Joseph, holding\\nout the letter.', '‘I don’t agree with the Filer party.', 'I don’t agree with\\nany party.', 'My friend the Poor Man, has no business with anything of that\\nsort, and nothing of that sort has any business with him.', 'My friend the\\nPoor Man, in my district, is my business.', 'No man or body of men has any\\nright to interfere between my friend and me.', 'That is the ground I take.', 'I assume a—a paternal character towards my friend.', 'I say, “My good\\nfellow, I will treat you paternally.”’\\n\\nToby listened with great gravity, and began to feel more comfortable.', '‘Your only business, my good fellow,’ pursued Sir Joseph, looking\\nabstractedly at Toby; ‘your only business in life is with me.', 'You\\nneedn’t trouble yourself to think about anything.', 'I will think for you;\\nI know what is good for you; I am your perpetual parent.', 'Such is the\\ndispensation of an all-wise Providence!', 'Now, the design of your creation\\nis—not that you should swill, and guzzle, and associate your enjoyments,\\nbrutally, with food; Toby thought remorsefully of the tripe; ‘but that\\nyou should feel the Dignity of Labour.', 'Go forth erect into the cheerful\\nmorning air, and—and stop there.', 'Live hard and temperately, be\\nrespectful, exercise your self-denial, bring up your family on next to\\nnothing, pay your rent as regularly as the clock strikes, be punctual in\\nyour dealings (I set you a good example; you will find Mr.', 'Fish, my\\nconfidential secretary, with a cash-box before him at all times); and you\\nmay trust to me to be your Friend and Father.’\\n\\n‘Nice children, indeed, Sir Joseph!’ said the lady, with a shudder.', '‘Rheumatisms, and fevers, and crooked legs, and asthmas, and all kinds of\\nhorrors!’\\n\\n‘My lady,’ returned Sir Joseph, with solemnity, ‘not the less am I the\\nPoor Man’s Friend and Father.', 'Not the less shall he receive\\nencouragement at my hands.', 'Every quarter-day he will be put in\\ncommunication with Mr.', 'Fish.', 'Every New Year’s Day, myself and friends\\nwill drink his health.', 'Once every year, myself and friends will address\\nhim with the deepest feeling.', 'Once in his life, he may even perhaps\\nreceive; in public, in the presence of the gentry; a Trifle from a\\nFriend.', 'And when, upheld no more by these stimulants, and the Dignity of\\nLabour, he sinks into his comfortable grave, then, my lady’—here Sir\\nJoseph blew his nose—‘I will be a Friend and a Father—on the same\\nterms—to his children.’\\n\\nToby was greatly moved.', '‘O!', 'You have a thankful family, Sir Joseph!’ cried his wife.', '‘My lady,’ said Sir Joseph, quite majestically, ‘Ingratitude is known to\\nbe the sin of that class.', 'I expect no other return.’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'Born bad!’ thought Toby.', '‘Nothing melts us.’\\n\\n‘What man can do, _I_ do,’ pursued Sir Joseph.', '‘I do my duty as the Poor\\nMan’s Friend and Father; and I endeavour to educate his mind, by\\ninculcating on all occasions the one great moral lesson which that class\\nrequires.', 'That is, entire Dependence on myself.', 'They have no business\\nwhatever with—with themselves.', 'If wicked and designing persons tell them\\notherwise, and they become impatient and discontented, and are guilty of\\ninsubordinate conduct and black-hearted ingratitude; which is undoubtedly\\nthe case; I am their Friend and Father still.', 'It is so Ordained.', 'It is\\nin the nature of things.’\\n\\nWith that great sentiment, he opened the Alderman’s letter; and read it.', '‘Very polite and attentive, I am sure!’ exclaimed Sir Joseph.', '‘My lady,\\nthe Alderman is so obliging as to remind me that he has had “the\\ndistinguished honour”—he is very good—of meeting me at the house of our\\nmutual friend Deedles, the banker; and he does me the favour to inquire\\nwhether it will be agreeable to me to have Will Fern put down.’\\n\\n‘_Most_ agreeable!’ replied my Lady Bowley.', '‘The worst man among them!', 'He has been committing a robbery, I hope?’\\n\\n‘Why no,’ said Sir Joseph’, referring to the letter.', '‘Not quite.', 'Very\\nnear.', 'Not quite.', 'He came up to London, it seems, to look for employment\\n(trying to better himself—that’s his story), and being found at night\\nasleep in a shed, was taken into custody, and carried next morning before\\nthe Alderman.', 'The Alderman observes (very properly) that he is\\ndetermined to put this sort of thing down; and that if it will be\\nagreeable to me to have Will Fern put down, he will be happy to begin\\nwith him.’\\n\\n‘Let him be made an example of, by all means,’ returned the lady.', '‘Last\\nwinter, when I introduced pinking and eyelet-holing among the men and\\nboys in the village, as a nice evening employment, and had the lines,\\n\\n    O let us love our occupations,\\n    Bless the squire and his relations,\\n    Live upon our daily rations,\\n    And always know our proper stations,\\n\\nset to music on the new system, for them to sing the while; this very\\nFern—I see him now—touched that hat of his, and said, “I humbly ask your\\npardon, my lady, but _an’t_ I something different from a great girl?”  I\\nexpected it, of course; who can expect anything but insolence and\\ningratitude from that class of people!', 'That is not to the purpose,\\nhowever.', 'Sir Joseph!', 'Make an example of him!’\\n\\n‘Hem!’ coughed Sir Joseph.', '‘Mr.', 'Fish, if you’ll have the goodness to\\nattend—’\\n\\nMr.', 'Fish immediately seized his pen, and wrote from Sir Joseph’s\\ndictation.', '‘Private.', 'My dear Sir.', 'I am very much indebted to you for your courtesy\\nin the matter of the man William Fern, of whom, I regret to add, I can\\nsay nothing favourable.', 'I have uniformly considered myself in the light\\nof his Friend and Father, but have been repaid (a common case, I grieve\\nto say) with ingratitude, and constant opposition to my plans.', 'He is a\\nturbulent and rebellious spirit.', 'His character will not bear\\ninvestigation.', 'Nothing will persuade him to be happy when he might.', 'Under these circumstances, it appears to me, I own, that when he comes\\nbefore you again (as you informed me he promised to do to-morrow, pending\\nyour inquiries, and I think he may be so far relied upon), his committal\\nfor some short term as a Vagabond, would be a service to society, and\\nwould be a salutary example in a country where—for the sake of those who\\nare, through good and evil report, the Friends and Fathers of the Poor,\\nas well as with a view to that, generally speaking, misguided class\\nthemselves—examples are greatly needed.', 'And I am,’ and so forth.', '‘It appears,’ remarked Sir Joseph when he had signed this letter, and Mr.', 'Fish was sealing it, ‘as if this were Ordained: really.', 'At the close of\\nthe year, I wind up my account and strike my balance, even with William\\nFern!’\\n\\nTrotty, who had long ago relapsed, and was very low-spirited, stepped\\nforward with a rueful face to take the letter.', '‘With my compliments and thanks,’ said Sir Joseph.', '‘Stop!’\\n\\n‘Stop!’ echoed Mr.', 'Fish.', '‘You have heard, perhaps,’ said Sir Joseph, oracularly, ‘certain remarks\\ninto which I have been led respecting the solemn period of time at which\\nwe have arrived, and the duty imposed upon us of settling our affairs,\\nand being prepared.', 'You have observed that I don’t shelter myself behind\\nmy superior standing in society, but that Mr. Fish—that gentleman—has a\\ncheque-book at his elbow, and is in fact here, to enable me to turn over\\na perfectly new leaf, and enter on the epoch before us with a clean\\naccount.', 'Now, my friend, can you lay your hand upon your heart, and say,\\nthat you also have made preparations for a New Year?’\\n\\n‘I am afraid, sir,’ stammered Trotty, looking meekly at him, ‘that I am\\na—a—little behind-hand with the world.’\\n\\n‘Behind-hand with the world!’ repeated Sir Joseph Bowley, in a tone of\\nterrible distinctness.', '‘I am afraid, sir,’ faltered Trotty, ‘that there’s a matter of ten or\\ntwelve shillings owing to Mrs. Chickenstalker.’\\n\\n‘To Mrs. Chickenstalker!’ repeated Sir Joseph, in the same tone as\\nbefore.', '‘A shop, sir,’ exclaimed Toby, ‘in the general line.', 'Also a—a little\\nmoney on account of rent.', 'A very little, sir.', 'It oughtn’t to be owing,\\nI know, but we have been hard put to it, indeed!’\\n\\nSir Joseph looked at his lady, and at Mr.', 'Fish, and at Trotty, one after\\nanother, twice all round.', 'He then made a despondent gesture with both\\nhands at once, as if he gave the thing up altogether.', '‘How a man, even among this improvident and impracticable race; an old\\nman; a man grown grey; can look a New Year in the face, with his affairs\\nin this condition; how he can lie down on his bed at night, and get up\\nagain in the morning, and—There!’ he said, turning his back on Trotty.', '‘Take the letter.', 'Take the letter!’\\n\\n‘I heartily wish it was otherwise, sir,’ said Trotty, anxious to excuse\\nhimself.', '‘We have been tried very hard.’\\n\\nSir Joseph still repeating ‘Take the letter, take the letter!’ and Mr.', 'Fish not only saying the same thing, but giving additional force to the\\nrequest by motioning the bearer to the door, he had nothing for it but to\\nmake his bow and leave the house.', 'And in the street, poor Trotty pulled\\nhis worn old hat down on his head, to hide the grief he felt at getting\\nno hold on the New Year, anywhere.', 'He didn’t even lift his hat to look up at the Bell tower when he came to\\nthe old church on his return.', 'He halted there a moment, from habit: and\\nknew that it was growing dark, and that the steeple rose above him,\\nindistinct and faint, in the murky air.', 'He knew, too, that the Chimes\\nwould ring immediately; and that they sounded to his fancy, at such a\\ntime, like voices in the clouds.', 'But he only made the more haste to\\ndeliver the Alderman’s letter, and get out of the way before they began;\\nfor he dreaded to hear them tagging ‘Friends and Fathers, Friends and\\nFathers,’ to the burden they had rung out last.', 'Toby discharged himself of his commission, therefore, with all possible\\nspeed, and set off trotting homeward.', 'But what with his pace, which was\\nat best an awkward one in the street; and what with his hat, which didn’t\\nimprove it; he trotted against somebody in less than no time, and was\\nsent staggering out into the road.', '‘I beg your pardon, I’m sure!’ said Trotty, pulling up his hat in great\\nconfusion, and between the hat and the torn lining, fixing his head into\\na kind of bee-hive.', '‘I hope I haven’t hurt you.’\\n\\nAs to hurting anybody, Toby was not such an absolute Samson, but that he\\nwas much more likely to be hurt himself: and indeed, he had flown out\\ninto the road, like a shuttlecock.', 'He had such an opinion of his own\\nstrength, however, that he was in real concern for the other party: and\\nsaid again,\\n\\n‘I hope I haven’t hurt you?’\\n\\nThe man against whom he had run; a sun-browned, sinewy, country-looking\\nman, with grizzled hair, and a rough chin; stared at him for a moment, as\\nif he suspected him to be in jest.', 'But, satisfied of his good faith, he\\nanswered:\\n\\n‘No, friend.', 'You have not hurt me.’\\n\\n‘Nor the child, I hope?’ said Trotty.', '‘Nor the child,’ returned the man.', '‘I thank you kindly.’\\n\\nAs he said so, he glanced at a little girl he carried in his arms,\\nasleep: and shading her face with the long end of the poor handkerchief\\nhe wore about his throat, went slowly on.', 'The tone in which he said ‘I thank you kindly,’ penetrated Trotty’s\\nheart.', 'He was so jaded and foot-sore, and so soiled with travel, and\\nlooked about him so forlorn and strange, that it was a comfort to him to\\nbe able to thank any one: no matter for how little.', 'Toby stood gazing\\nafter him as he plodded wearily away, with the child’s arm clinging round\\nhis neck.', 'At the figure in the worn shoes—now the very shade and ghost of\\nshoes—rough leather leggings, common frock, and broad slouched hat,\\nTrotty stood gazing, blind to the whole street.', 'And at the child’s arm,\\nclinging round its neck.', 'Before he merged into the darkness the traveller stopped; and looking\\nround, and seeing Trotty standing there yet, seemed undecided whether to\\nreturn or go on.', 'After doing first the one and then the other, he came\\nback, and Trotty went half-way to meet him.', '‘You can tell me, perhaps,’ said the man with a faint smile, ‘and if you\\ncan I am sure you will, and I’d rather ask you than another—where\\nAlderman Cute lives.’\\n\\n‘Close at hand,’ replied Toby.', '‘I’ll show you his house with pleasure.’\\n\\n‘I was to have gone to him elsewhere to-morrow,’ said the man,\\naccompanying Toby, ‘but I’m uneasy under suspicion, and want to clear\\nmyself, and to be free to go and seek my bread—I don’t know where.', 'So,\\nmaybe he’ll forgive my going to his house to-night.’\\n\\n‘It’s impossible,’ cried Toby with a start, ‘that your name’s Fern!’\\n\\n‘Eh!’ cried the other, turning on him in astonishment.', '‘Fern!', 'Will Fern!’ said Trotty.', '‘That’s my name,’ replied the other.', '‘Why then,’ said Trotty, seizing him by the arm, and looking cautiously\\nround, ‘for Heaven’s sake don’t go to him!', 'Don’t go to him!', 'He’ll put\\nyou down as sure as ever you were born.', 'Here!', 'come up this alley, and\\nI’ll tell you what I mean.', 'Don’t go to _him_.’\\n\\nHis new acquaintance looked as if he thought him mad; but he bore him\\ncompany nevertheless.', 'When they were shrouded from observation, Trotty\\ntold him what he knew, and what character he had received, and all about\\nit.', 'The subject of his history listened to it with a calmness that surprised\\nhim.', 'He did not contradict or interrupt it, once.', 'He nodded his head\\nnow and then—more in corroboration of an old and worn-out story, it\\nappeared, than in refutation of it; and once or twice threw back his hat,\\nand passed his freckled hand over a brow, where every furrow he had\\nploughed seemed to have set its image in little.', 'But he did no more.', '‘It’s true enough in the main,’ he said, ‘master, I could sift grain from\\nhusk here and there, but let it be as ’tis.', 'What odds?', 'I have gone\\nagainst his plans; to my misfortun’.', 'I can’t help it; I should do the\\nlike to-morrow.', 'As to character, them gentlefolks will search and\\nsearch, and pry and pry, and have it as free from spot or speck in us,\\nafore they’ll help us to a dry good word!—Well!', 'I hope they don’t lose\\ngood opinion as easy as we do, or their lives is strict indeed, and\\nhardly worth the keeping.', 'For myself, master, I never took with that\\nhand’—holding it before him—‘what wasn’t my own; and never held it back\\nfrom work, however hard, or poorly paid.', 'Whoever can deny it, let him\\nchop it off!', 'But when work won’t maintain me like a human creetur; when\\nmy living is so bad, that I am Hungry, out of doors and in; when I see a\\nwhole working life begin that way, go on that way, and end that way,\\nwithout a chance or change; then I say to the gentlefolks “Keep away from\\nme!', 'Let my cottage be.', 'My doors is dark enough without your darkening\\nof ’em more.', 'Don’t look for me to come up into the Park to help the show\\nwhen there’s a Birthday, or a fine Speechmaking, or what not.', 'Act your\\nPlays and Games without me, and be welcome to ’em, and enjoy ’em.', 'We’ve\\nnowt to do with one another.', 'I’m best let alone!”’\\n\\nSeeing that the child in his arms had opened her eyes, and was looking\\nabout her in wonder, he checked himself to say a word or two of foolish\\nprattle in her ear, and stand her on the ground beside him.', 'Then slowly\\nwinding one of her long tresses round and round his rough forefinger like\\na ring, while she hung about his dusty leg, he said to Trotty:\\n\\n‘I’m not a cross-grained man by natu’, I believe; and easy satisfied, I’m\\nsure.', 'I bear no ill-will against none of ’em.', 'I only want to live like\\none of the Almighty’s creeturs.', 'I can’t—I don’t—and so there’s a pit dug\\nbetween me, and them that can and do.', 'There’s others like me.', 'You might\\ntell ’em off by hundreds and by thousands, sooner than by ones.’\\n\\nTrotty knew he spoke the Truth in this, and shook his head to signify as\\nmuch.', '‘I’ve got a bad name this way,’ said Fern; ‘and I’m not likely, I’m\\nafeared, to get a better.', '’Tan’t lawful to be out of sorts, and I AM out\\nof sorts, though God knows I’d sooner bear a cheerful spirit if I could.', 'Well!', 'I don’t know as this Alderman could hurt _me_ much by sending me\\nto jail; but without a friend to speak a word for me, he might do it; and\\nyou see—!’ pointing downward with his finger, at the child.', '‘She has a beautiful face,’ said Trotty.', '‘Why yes!’ replied the other in a low voice, as he gently turned it up\\nwith both his hands towards his own, and looked upon it steadfastly.', '‘I’ve thought so, many times.', 'I’ve thought so, when my hearth was very\\ncold, and cupboard very bare.', 'I thought so t’other night, when we were\\ntaken like two thieves.', 'But they—they shouldn’t try the little face too\\noften, should they, Lilian?', 'That’s hardly fair upon a man!’\\n\\nHe sunk his voice so low, and gazed upon her with an air so stern and\\nstrange, that Toby, to divert the current of his thoughts, inquired if\\nhis wife were living.', '‘I never had one,’ he returned, shaking his head.', '‘She’s my brother’s\\nchild: a orphan.', 'Nine year old, though you’d hardly think it; but she’s\\ntired and worn out now.', 'They’d have taken care on her, the\\nUnion—eight-and-twenty mile away from where we live—between four walls\\n(as they took care of my old father when he couldn’t work no more, though\\nhe didn’t trouble ’em long); but I took her instead, and she’s lived with\\nme ever since.', 'Her mother had a friend once, in London here.', 'We are\\ntrying to find her, and to find work too; but it’s a large place.', 'Never\\nmind.', 'More room for us to walk about in, Lilly!’\\n\\nMeeting the child’s eyes with a smile which melted Toby more than tears,\\nhe shook him by the hand.', '‘I don’t so much as know your name,’ he said, ‘but I’ve opened my heart\\nfree to you, for I’m thankful to you; with good reason.', 'I’ll take your\\nadvice, and keep clear of this—’\\n\\n‘Justice,’ suggested Toby.', '‘Ah!’ he said.', '‘If that’s the name they give him.', 'This Justice.', 'And\\nto-morrow will try whether there’s better fortun’ to be met with,\\nsomewheres near London.', 'Good night.', 'A Happy New Year!’\\n\\n‘Stay!’ cried Trotty, catching at his hand, as he relaxed his grip.', '‘Stay!', 'The New Year never can be happy to me, if we part like this.', 'The\\nNew Year never can be happy to me, if I see the child and you go\\nwandering away, you don’t know where, without a shelter for your heads.', 'Come home with me!', 'I’m a poor man, living in a poor place; but I can\\ngive you lodging for one night and never miss it.', 'Come home with me!', 'Here!', 'I’ll take her!’ cried Trotty, lifting up the child.', '‘A pretty\\none!', 'I’d carry twenty times her weight, and never know I’d got it.', 'Tell\\nme if I go too quick for you.', 'I’m very fast.', 'I always was!’  Trotty\\nsaid this, taking about six of his trotting paces to one stride of his\\nfatigued companion; and with his thin legs quivering again, beneath the\\nload he bore.', '‘Why, she’s as light,’ said Trotty, trotting in his speech as well as in\\nhis gait; for he couldn’t bear to be thanked, and dreaded a moment’s\\npause; ‘as light as a feather.', 'Lighter than a Peacock’s feather—a great\\ndeal lighter.', 'Here we are and here we go!', 'Round this first turning to\\nthe right, Uncle Will, and past the pump, and sharp off up the passage to\\nthe left, right opposite the public-house.', 'Here we are and here we go!', 'Cross over, Uncle Will, and mind the kidney pieman at the corner!', 'Here\\nwe are and here we go!', 'Down the Mews here, Uncle Will, and stop at the\\nblack door, with “T.', 'Veck, Ticket Porter,” wrote upon a board; and here\\nwe are and here we go, and here we are indeed, my precious.', 'Meg,\\nsurprising you!’\\n\\nWith which words Trotty, in a breathless state, set the child down before\\nhis daughter in the middle of the floor.', 'The little visitor looked once\\nat Meg; and doubting nothing in that face, but trusting everything she\\nsaw there; ran into her arms.', '‘Here we are and here we go!’ cried Trotty, running round the room, and\\nchoking audibly.', '‘Here, Uncle Will, here’s a fire you know!', 'Why don’t\\nyou come to the fire?', 'Oh here we are and here we go!', 'Meg, my precious\\ndarling, where’s the kettle?', 'Here it is and here it goes, and it’ll bile\\nin no time!’\\n\\nTrotty really had picked up the kettle somewhere or other in the course\\nof his wild career and now put it on the fire: while Meg, seating the\\nchild in a warm corner, knelt down on the ground before her, and pulled\\noff her shoes, and dried her wet feet on a cloth.', 'Ay, and she laughed at\\nTrotty too—so pleasantly, so cheerfully, that Trotty could have blessed\\nher where she kneeled; for he had seen that, when they entered, she was\\nsitting by the fire in tears.', '‘Why, father!’ said Meg.', '‘You’re crazy to-night, I think.', 'I don’t know\\nwhat the Bells would say to that.', 'Poor little feet.', 'How cold they are!’\\n\\n‘Oh, they’re warmer now!’ exclaimed the child.', '‘They’re quite warm now!’\\n\\n‘No, no, no,’ said Meg.', '‘We haven’t rubbed ’em half enough.', 'We’re so\\nbusy.', 'So busy!', 'And when they’re done, we’ll brush out the damp hair;\\nand when that’s done, we’ll bring some colour to the poor pale face with\\nfresh water; and when that’s done, we’ll be so gay, and brisk, and\\nhappy—!’\\n\\nThe child, in a burst of sobbing, clasped her round the neck; caressed\\nher fair cheek with its hand; and said, ‘Oh Meg!', 'oh dear Meg!’\\n\\nToby’s blessing could have done no more.', 'Who could do more!', '‘Why, father!’ cried Meg, after a pause.', '‘Here I am and here I go, my dear!’ said Trotty.', '‘Good Gracious me!’ cried Meg.', '‘He’s crazy!', 'He’s put the dear child’s\\nbonnet on the kettle, and hung the lid behind the door!’\\n\\n‘I didn’t go for to do it, my love,’ said Trotty, hastily repairing this\\nmistake.', '‘Meg, my dear?’\\n\\nMeg looked towards him and saw that he had elaborately stationed himself\\nbehind the chair of their male visitor, where with many mysterious\\ngestures he was holding up the sixpence he had earned.', '‘I see, my dear,’ said Trotty, ‘as I was coming in, half an ounce of tea\\nlying somewhere on the stairs; and I’m pretty sure there was a bit of\\nbacon too.', 'As I don’t remember where it was exactly, I’ll go myself and\\ntry to find ’em.’\\n\\nWith this inscrutable artifice, Toby withdrew to purchase the viands he\\nhad spoken of, for ready money, at Mrs. Chickenstalker’s; and presently\\ncame back, pretending he had not been able to find them, at first, in the\\ndark.', '‘But here they are at last,’ said Trotty, setting out the tea-things,\\n‘all correct!', 'I was pretty sure it was tea, and a rasher.', 'So it is.', 'Meg, my pet, if you’ll just make the tea, while your unworthy father\\ntoasts the bacon, we shall be ready, immediate.', 'It’s a curious\\ncircumstance,’ said Trotty, proceeding in his cookery, with the\\nassistance of the toasting-fork, ‘curious, but well known to my friends,\\nthat I never care, myself, for rashers, nor for tea.', 'I like to see other\\npeople enjoy ’em,’ said Trotty, speaking very loud, to impress the fact\\nupon his guest, ‘but to me, as food, they’re disagreeable.’\\n\\nYet Trotty sniffed the savour of the hissing bacon—ah!—as if he liked it;\\nand when he poured the boiling water in the tea-pot, looked lovingly down\\ninto the depths of that snug cauldron, and suffered the fragrant steam to\\ncurl about his nose, and wreathe his head and face in a thick cloud.', 'However, for all this, he neither ate nor drank, except at the very\\nbeginning, a mere morsel for form’s sake, which he appeared to eat with\\ninfinite relish, but declared was perfectly uninteresting to him.', 'No.', 'Trotty’s occupation was, to see Will Fern and Lilian eat and drink;\\nand so was Meg’s.', 'And never did spectators at a city dinner or court\\nbanquet find such high delight in seeing others feast: although it were a\\nmonarch or a pope: as those two did, in looking on that night.', 'Meg\\nsmiled at Trotty, Trotty laughed at Meg.', 'Meg shook her head, and made\\nbelief to clap her hands, applauding Trotty; Trotty conveyed, in\\ndumb-show, unintelligible narratives of how and when and where he had\\nfound their visitors, to Meg; and they were happy.', 'Very happy.', '‘Although,’ thought Trotty, sorrowfully, as he watched Meg’s face; ‘that\\nmatch is broken off, I see!’\\n\\n‘Now, I’ll tell you what,’ said Trotty after tea.', '‘The little one, she\\nsleeps with Meg, I know.’\\n\\n‘With good Meg!’ cried the child, caressing her.', '‘With Meg.’\\n\\n‘That’s right,’ said Trotty.', '‘And I shouldn’t wonder if she kiss Meg’s\\nfather, won’t she?', '_I’m_ Meg’s father.’\\n\\nMightily delighted Trotty was, when the child went timidly towards him,\\nand having kissed him, fell back upon Meg again.', '‘She’s as sensible as Solomon,’ said Trotty.', '‘Here we come and here\\nwe—no, we don’t—I don’t mean that—I—what was I saying, Meg, my precious?’\\n\\nMeg looked towards their guest, who leaned upon her chair, and with his\\nface turned from her, fondled the child’s head, half hidden in her lap.', '‘To be sure,’ said Toby.', '‘To be sure!', 'I don’t know what I’m rambling on\\nabout, to-night.', 'My wits are wool-gathering, I think.', 'Will Fern, you\\ncome along with me.', 'You’re tired to death, and broken down for want of\\nrest.', 'You come along with me.’  The man still played with the child’s\\ncurls, still leaned upon Meg’s chair, still turned away his face.', 'He\\ndidn’t speak, but in his rough coarse fingers, clenching and expanding in\\nthe fair hair of the child, there was an eloquence that said enough.', '‘Yes, yes,’ said Trotty, answering unconsciously what he saw expressed in\\nhis daughter’s face.', '‘Take her with you, Meg.', 'Get her to bed.', 'There!', 'Now, Will, I’ll show you where you lie.', 'It’s not much of a place: only a\\nloft; but, having a loft, I always say, is one of the great conveniences\\nof living in a mews; and till this coach-house and stable gets a better\\nlet, we live here cheap.', 'There’s plenty of sweet hay up there, belonging\\nto a neighbour; and it’s as clean as hands, and Meg, can make it.', 'Cheer\\nup!', 'Don’t give way.', 'A new heart for a New Year, always!’\\n\\nThe hand released from the child’s hair, had fallen, trembling, into\\nTrotty’s hand.', 'So Trotty, talking without intermission, led him out as\\ntenderly and easily as if he had been a child himself.', 'Returning before\\nMeg, he listened for an instant at the door of her little chamber; an\\nadjoining room.', 'The child was murmuring a simple Prayer before lying\\ndown to sleep; and when she had remembered Meg’s name, ‘Dearly,\\nDearly’—so her words ran—Trotty heard her stop and ask for his.', 'It was some short time before the foolish little old fellow could compose\\nhimself to mend the fire, and draw his chair to the warm hearth.', 'But,\\nwhen he had done so, and had trimmed the light, he took his newspaper\\nfrom his pocket, and began to read.', 'Carelessly at first, and skimming up\\nand down the columns; but with an earnest and a sad attention, very soon.', 'For this same dreaded paper re-directed Trotty’s thoughts into the\\nchannel they had taken all that day, and which the day’s events had so\\nmarked out and shaped.', 'His interest in the two wanderers had set him on\\nanother course of thinking, and a happier one, for the time; but being\\nalone again, and reading of the crimes and violences of the people, he\\nrelapsed into his former train.', 'In this mood, he came to an account (and it was not the first he had ever\\nread) of a woman who had laid her desperate hands not only on her own\\nlife but on that of her young child.', 'A crime so terrible, and so\\nrevolting to his soul, dilated with the love of Meg, that he let the\\njournal drop, and fell back in his chair, appalled!', '‘Unnatural and cruel!’ Toby cried.', '‘Unnatural and cruel!', 'None but\\npeople who were bad at heart, born bad, who had no business on the earth,\\ncould do such deeds.', 'It’s too true, all I’ve heard to-day; too just, too\\nfull of proof.', 'We’re Bad!’\\n\\nThe Chimes took up the words so suddenly—burst out so loud, and clear,\\nand sonorous—that the Bells seemed to strike him in his chair.', 'And what was that, they said?', '‘Toby Veck, Toby Veck, waiting for you Toby!', 'Toby Veck, Toby Veck,\\nwaiting for you Toby!', 'Come and see us, come and see us, Drag him to us,\\ndrag him to us, Haunt and hunt him, haunt and hunt him, Break his\\nslumbers, break his slumbers!', 'Toby Veck Toby Veck, door open wide Toby,\\nToby Veck Toby Veck, door open wide Toby—’ then fiercely back to their\\nimpetuous strain again, and ringing in the very bricks and plaster on the\\nwalls.', 'Toby listened.', 'Fancy, fancy!', 'His remorse for having run away from them\\nthat afternoon!', 'No, no.', 'Nothing of the kind.', 'Again, again, and yet a\\ndozen times again.', '‘Haunt and hunt him, haunt and hunt him, Drag him to\\nus, drag him to us!’  Deafening the whole town!', '‘Meg,’ said Trotty softly: tapping at her door.', '‘Do you hear anything?’\\n\\n‘I hear the Bells, father.', 'Surely they’re very loud to-night.’\\n\\n‘Is she asleep?’ said Toby, making an excuse for peeping in.', '‘So peacefully and happily!', 'I can’t leave her yet though, father.', 'Look\\nhow she holds my hand!’\\n\\n‘Meg,’ whispered Trotty.', '‘Listen to the Bells!’\\n\\nShe listened, with her face towards him all the time.', 'But it underwent\\nno change.', 'She didn’t understand them.', 'Trotty withdrew, resumed his seat by the fire, and once more listened by\\nhimself.', 'He remained here a little time.', 'It was impossible to bear it; their energy was dreadful.', '‘If the tower-door is really open,’ said Toby, hastily laying aside his\\napron, but never thinking of his hat, ‘what’s to hinder me from going up\\ninto the steeple and satisfying myself?', 'If it’s shut, I don’t want any\\nother satisfaction.', 'That’s enough.’\\n\\nHe was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the street that he\\nshould find it shut and locked, for he knew the door well, and had so\\nrarely seen it open, that he couldn’t reckon above three times in all.', 'It was a low arched portal, outside the church, in a dark nook behind a\\ncolumn; and had such great iron hinges, and such a monstrous lock, that\\nthere was more hinge and lock than door.', 'But what was his astonishment when, coming bare-headed to the church; and\\nputting his hand into this dark nook, with a certain misgiving that it\\nmight be unexpectedly seized, and a shivering propensity to draw it back\\nagain; he found that the door, which opened outwards, actually stood\\najar!', 'He thought, on the first surprise, of going back; or of getting a light,\\nor a companion, but his courage aided him immediately, and he determined\\nto ascend alone.', '‘What have I to fear?’ said Trotty.', '‘It’s a church!', 'Besides, the\\nringers may be there, and have forgotten to shut the door.’  So he went\\nin, feeling his way as he went, like a blind man; for it was very dark.', 'And very quiet, for the Chimes were silent.', 'The dust from the street had blown into the recess; and lying there,\\nheaped up, made it so soft and velvet-like to the foot, that there was\\nsomething startling, even in that.', 'The narrow stair was so close to the\\ndoor, too, that he stumbled at the very first; and shutting the door upon\\nhimself, by striking it with his foot, and causing it to rebound back\\nheavily, he couldn’t open it again.', 'This was another reason, however, for going on.', 'Trotty groped his way,\\nand went on.', 'Up, up, up, and round, and round; and up, up, up; higher,\\nhigher, higher up!', 'It was a disagreeable staircase for that groping work; so low and narrow,\\nthat his groping hand was always touching something; and it often felt so\\nlike a man or ghostly figure standing up erect and making room for him to\\npass without discovery, that he would rub the smooth wall upward\\nsearching for its face, and downward searching for its feet, while a\\nchill tingling crept all over him.', 'Twice or thrice, a door or niche\\nbroke the monotonous surface; and then it seemed a gap as wide as the\\nwhole church; and he felt on the brink of an abyss, and going to tumble\\nheadlong down, until he found the wall again.', 'Still up, up, up; and round and round; and up, up, up; higher, higher,\\nhigher up!', 'At length, the dull and stifling atmosphere began to freshen: presently\\nto feel quite windy: presently it blew so strong, that he could hardly\\nkeep his legs.', 'But, he got to an arched window in the tower, breast\\nhigh, and holding tight, looked down upon the house-tops, on the smoking\\nchimneys, on the blur and blotch of lights (towards the place where Meg\\nwas wondering where he was and calling to him perhaps), all kneaded up\\ntogether in a leaven of mist and darkness.', 'This was the belfry, where the ringers came.', 'He had caught hold of one\\nof the frayed ropes which hung down through apertures in the oaken roof.', 'At first he started, thinking it was hair; then trembled at the very\\nthought of waking the deep Bell.', 'The Bells themselves were higher.', 'Higher, Trotty, in his fascination, or in working out the spell upon him,\\ngroped his way.', 'By ladders now, and toilsomely, for it was steep, and\\nnot too certain holding for the feet.', 'Up, up, up; and climb and clamber; up, up, up; higher, higher, higher up!', 'Until, ascending through the floor, and pausing with his head just raised\\nabove its beams, he came among the Bells.', 'It was barely possible to make\\nout their great shapes in the gloom; but there they were.', 'Shadowy, and\\ndark, and dumb.', 'A heavy sense of dread and loneliness fell instantly upon him, as he\\nclimbed into this airy nest of stone and metal.', 'His head went round and\\nround.', 'He listened, and then raised a wild ‘Holloa!’  Holloa!', 'was\\nmournfully protracted by the echoes.', 'Giddy, confused, and out of breath, and frightened, Toby looked about him\\nvacantly, and sunk down in a swoon.', 'CHAPTER III—Third Quarter.', 'Black are the brooding clouds and troubled the deep waters, when the Sea\\nof Thought, first heaving from a calm, gives up its Dead.', 'Monsters\\nuncouth and wild, arise in premature, imperfect resurrection; the several\\nparts and shapes of different things are joined and mixed by chance; and\\nwhen, and how, and by what wonderful degrees, each separates from each,\\nand every sense and object of the mind resumes its usual form and lives\\nagain, no man—though every man is every day the casket of this type of\\nthe Great Mystery—can tell.', 'So, when and how the darkness of the night-black steeple changed to\\nshining light; when and how the solitary tower was peopled with a myriad\\nfigures; when and how the whispered ‘Haunt and hunt him,’ breathing\\nmonotonously through his sleep or swoon, became a voice exclaiming in the\\nwaking ears of Trotty, ‘Break his slumbers;’ when and how he ceased to\\nhave a sluggish and confused idea that such things were, companioning a\\nhost of others that were not; there are no dates or means to tell.', 'But,\\nawake and standing on his feet upon the boards where he had lately lain,\\nhe saw this Goblin Sight.', 'He saw the tower, whither his charmed footsteps had brought him, swarming\\nwith dwarf phantoms, spirits, elfin creatures of the Bells.', 'He saw them\\nleaping, flying, dropping, pouring from the Bells without a pause.', 'He\\nsaw them, round him on the ground; above him, in the air; clambering from\\nhim, by the ropes below; looking down upon him, from the massive\\niron-girded beams; peeping in upon him, through the chinks and loopholes\\nin the walls; spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles, as\\nthe water ripples give way to a huge stone that suddenly comes plashing\\nin among them.', 'He saw them, of all aspects and all shapes.', 'He saw them\\nugly, handsome, crippled, exquisitely formed.', 'He saw them young, he saw\\nthem old, he saw them kind, he saw them cruel, he saw them merry, he saw\\nthem grim; he saw them dance, and heard them sing; he saw them tear their\\nhair, and heard them howl.', 'He saw the air thick with them.', 'He saw them\\ncome and go, incessantly.', 'He saw them riding downward, soaring upward,\\nsailing off afar, perching near at hand, all restless and all violently\\nactive.', 'Stone, and brick, and slate, and tile, became transparent to him\\nas to them.', 'He saw them _in_ the houses, busy at the sleepers’ beds.', 'He\\nsaw them soothing people in their dreams; he saw them beating them with\\nknotted whips; he saw them yelling in their ears; he saw them playing\\nsoftest music on their pillows; he saw them cheering some with the songs\\nof birds and the perfume of flowers; he saw them flashing awful faces on\\nthe troubled rest of others, from enchanted mirrors which they carried in\\ntheir hands.', 'He saw these creatures, not only among sleeping men but waking also,\\nactive in pursuits irreconcilable with one another, and possessing or\\nassuming natures the most opposite.', 'He saw one buckling on innumerable\\nwings to increase his speed; another loading himself with chains and\\nweights, to retard his.', 'He saw some putting the hands of clocks forward,\\nsome putting the hands of clocks backward, some endeavouring to stop the\\nclock entirely.', 'He saw them representing, here a marriage ceremony,\\nthere a funeral; in this chamber an election, in that a ball he saw,\\neverywhere, restless and untiring motion.', 'Bewildered by the host of shifting and extraordinary figures, as well as\\nby the uproar of the Bells, which all this while were ringing, Trotty\\nclung to a wooden pillar for support, and turned his white face here and\\nthere, in mute and stunned astonishment.', 'As he gazed, the Chimes stopped.', 'Instantaneous change!', 'The whole swarm\\nfainted!', 'their forms collapsed, their speed deserted them; they sought to\\nfly, but in the act of falling died and melted into air.', 'No fresh supply\\nsucceeded them.', 'One straggler leaped down pretty briskly from the\\nsurface of the Great Bell, and alighted on his feet, but he was dead and\\ngone before he could turn round.', 'Some few of the late company who had\\ngambolled in the tower, remained there, spinning over and over a little\\nlonger; but these became at every turn more faint, and few, and feeble,\\nand soon went the way of the rest.', 'The last of all was one small\\nhunchback, who had got into an echoing corner, where he twirled and\\ntwirled, and floated by himself a long time; showing such perseverance,\\nthat at last he dwindled to a leg and even to a foot, before he finally\\nretired; but he vanished in the end, and then the tower was silent.', 'Then and not before, did Trotty see in every Bell a bearded figure of the\\nbulk and stature of the Bell—incomprehensibly, a figure and the Bell\\nitself.', 'Gigantic, grave, and darkly watchful of him, as he stood rooted\\nto the ground.', 'Mysterious and awful figures!', 'Resting on nothing; poised in the night\\nair of the tower, with their draped and hooded heads merged in the dim\\nroof; motionless and shadowy.', 'Shadowy and dark, although he saw them by\\nsome light belonging to themselves—none else was there—each with its\\nmuffled hand upon its goblin mouth.', 'He could not plunge down wildly through the opening in the floor; for all\\npower of motion had deserted him.', 'Otherwise he would have done so—aye,\\nwould have thrown himself, headforemost, from the steeple-top, rather\\nthan have seen them watching him with eyes that would have waked and\\nwatched although the pupils had been taken out.', 'Again, again, the dread and terror of the lonely place, and of the wild\\nand fearful night that reigned there, touched him like a spectral hand.', 'His distance from all help; the long, dark, winding, ghost-beleaguered\\nway that lay between him and the earth on which men lived; his being\\nhigh, high, high, up there, where it had made him dizzy to see the birds\\nfly in the day; cut off from all good people, who at such an hour were\\nsafe at home and sleeping in their beds; all this struck coldly through\\nhim, not as a reflection but a bodily sensation.', 'Meantime his eyes and\\nthoughts and fears, were fixed upon the watchful figures; which, rendered\\nunlike any figures of this world by the deep gloom and shade enwrapping\\nand enfolding them, as well as by their looks and forms and supernatural\\nhovering above the floor, were nevertheless as plainly to be seen as were\\nthe stalwart oaken frames, cross-pieces, bars and beams, set up there to\\nsupport the Bells.', 'These hemmed them, in a very forest of hewn timber;\\nfrom the entanglements, intricacies, and depths of which, as from among\\nthe boughs of a dead wood blighted for their phantom use, they kept their\\ndarksome and unwinking watch.', 'A blast of air—how cold and shrill!—came moaning through the tower.', 'As\\nit died away, the Great Bell, or the Goblin of the Great Bell, spoke.', '‘What visitor is this!’ it said.', 'The voice was low and deep, and Trotty\\nfancied that it sounded in the other figures as well.', '‘I thought my name was called by the Chimes!’ said Trotty, raising his\\nhands in an attitude of supplication.', '‘I hardly know why I am here, or\\nhow I came.', 'I have listened to the Chimes these many years.', 'They have\\ncheered me often.’\\n\\n‘And you have thanked them?’ said the Bell.', '‘A thousand times!’ cried Trotty.', '‘How?’\\n\\n‘I am a poor man,’ faltered Trotty, ‘and could only thank them in words.’\\n\\n‘And always so?’ inquired the Goblin of the Bell.', '‘Have you never done\\nus wrong in words?’\\n\\n‘No!’ cried Trotty eagerly.', '‘Never done us foul, and false, and wicked wrong, in words?’ pursued the\\nGoblin of the Bell.', 'Trotty was about to answer, ‘Never!’  But he stopped, and was confused.', '‘The voice of Time,’ said the Phantom, ‘cries to man, Advance!', 'Time is\\nfor his advancement and improvement; for his greater worth, his greater\\nhappiness, his better life; his progress onward to that goal within its\\nknowledge and its view, and set there, in the period when Time and He\\nbegan.', 'Ages of darkness, wickedness, and violence, have come and\\ngone—millions uncountable, have suffered, lived, and died—to point the\\nway before him.', 'Who seeks to turn him back, or stay him on his course,\\narrests a mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead; and be the\\nfiercer and the wilder, ever, for its momentary check!’\\n\\n‘I never did so to my knowledge, sir,’ said Trotty.', '‘It was quite by\\naccident if I did.', 'I wouldn’t go to do it, I’m sure.’\\n\\n‘Who puts into the mouth of Time, or of its servants,’ said the Goblin of\\nthe Bell, ‘a cry of lamentation for days which have had their trial and\\ntheir failure, and have left deep traces of it which the blind may see—a\\ncry that only serves the present time, by showing men how much it needs\\ntheir help when any ears can listen to regrets for such a past—who does\\nthis, does a wrong.', 'And you have done that wrong, to us, the Chimes.’\\n\\nTrotty’s first excess of fear was gone.', 'But he had felt tenderly and\\ngratefully towards the Bells, as you have seen; and when he heard himself\\narraigned as one who had offended them so weightily, his heart was\\ntouched with penitence and grief.', '‘If you knew,’ said Trotty, clasping his hands earnestly—‘or perhaps you\\ndo know—if you know how often you have kept me company; how often you\\nhave cheered me up when I’ve been low; how you were quite the plaything\\nof my little daughter Meg (almost the only one she ever had) when first\\nher mother died, and she and me were left alone; you won’t bear malice\\nfor a hasty word!’\\n\\n‘Who hears in us, the Chimes, one note bespeaking disregard, or stern\\nregard, of any hope, or joy, or pain, or sorrow, of the many-sorrowed\\nthrong; who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human\\npassions and affections, as it gauges the amount of miserable food on\\nwhich humanity may pine and wither; does us wrong.', 'That wrong you have\\ndone us!’ said the Bell.', '‘I have!’ said Trotty.', '‘Oh forgive me!’\\n\\n‘Who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth: the Putters Down of\\ncrushed and broken natures, formed to be raised up higher than such\\nmaggots of the time can crawl or can conceive,’ pursued the Goblin of the\\nBell; ‘who does so, does us wrong.', 'And you have done us wrong!’\\n\\n‘Not meaning it,’ said Trotty.', '‘In my ignorance.', 'Not meaning it!’\\n\\n‘Lastly, and most of all,’ pursued the Bell.', '‘Who turns his back upon\\nthe fallen and disfigured of his kind; abandons them as vile; and does\\nnot trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which\\nthey fell from good—grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that\\nlost soil, and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf\\nbelow; does wrong to Heaven and man, to time and to eternity.', 'And you\\nhave done that wrong!’\\n\\n‘Spare me!’ cried Trotty, falling on his knees; ‘for Mercy’s sake!’\\n\\n‘Listen!’ said the Shadow.', '‘Listen!’ cried the other Shadows.', '‘Listen!’ said a clear and childlike voice, which Trotty thought he\\nrecognised as having heard before.', 'The organ sounded faintly in the church below.', 'Swelling by degrees, the\\nmelody ascended to the roof, and filled the choir and nave.', 'Expanding\\nmore and more, it rose up, up; up, up; higher, higher, higher up;\\nawakening agitated hearts within the burly piles of oak: the hollow\\nbells, the iron-bound doors, the stairs of solid stone; until the tower\\nwalls were insufficient to contain it, and it soared into the sky.', 'No wonder that an old man’s breast could not contain a sound so vast and\\nmighty.', 'It broke from that weak prison in a rush of tears; and Trotty\\nput his hands before his face.', '‘Listen!’ said the Shadow.', '‘Listen!’ said the other Shadows.', '‘Listen!’ said the child’s voice.', 'A solemn strain of blended voices, rose into the tower.', 'It was a very low and mournful strain—a Dirge—and as he listened, Trotty\\nheard his child among the singers.', '‘She is dead!’ exclaimed the old man.', '‘Meg is dead!', 'Her Spirit calls to\\nme.', 'I hear it!’\\n\\n‘The Spirit of your child bewails the dead, and mingles with the\\ndead—dead hopes, dead fancies, dead imaginings of youth,’ returned the\\nBell, ‘but she is living.', 'Learn from her life, a living truth.', 'Learn\\nfrom the creature dearest to your heart, how bad the bad are born.', 'See\\nevery bud and leaf plucked one by one from off the fairest stem, and know\\nhow bare and wretched it may be.', 'Follow her!', 'To desperation!’\\n\\nEach of the shadowy figures stretched its right arm forth, and pointed\\ndownward.', '‘The Spirit of the Chimes is your companion,’ said the figure.', '‘Go!', 'It stands behind you!’\\n\\nTrotty turned, and saw—the child!', 'The child Will Fern had carried in the\\nstreet; the child whom Meg had watched, but now, asleep!', '‘I carried her myself, to-night,’ said Trotty.', '‘In these arms!’\\n\\n‘Show him what he calls himself,’ said the dark figures, one and all.', 'The tower opened at his feet.', 'He looked down, and beheld his own form,\\nlying at the bottom, on the outside: crushed and motionless.', '‘No more a living man!’ cried Trotty.', '‘Dead!’\\n\\n‘Dead!’ said the figures all together.', '‘Gracious Heaven!', 'And the New Year—’\\n\\n‘Past,’ said the figures.', '‘What!’ he cried, shuddering.', '‘I missed my way, and coming on the\\noutside of this tower in the dark, fell down—a year ago?’\\n\\n‘Nine years ago!’ replied the figures.', 'As they gave the answer, they recalled their outstretched hands; and\\nwhere their figures had been, there the Bells were.', 'And they rung; their time being come again.', 'And once again, vast\\nmultitudes of phantoms sprung into existence; once again, were\\nincoherently engaged, as they had been before; once again, faded on the\\nstopping of the Chimes; and dwindled into nothing.', '‘What are these?’ he asked his guide.', '‘If I am not mad, what are these?’\\n\\n‘Spirits of the Bells.', 'Their sound upon the air,’ returned the child.', '‘They take such shapes and occupations as the hopes and thoughts of\\nmortals, and the recollections they have stored up, give them.’\\n\\n‘And you,’ said Trotty wildly.', '‘What are you?’\\n\\n‘Hush, hush!’ returned the child.', '‘Look here!’\\n\\nIn a poor, mean room; working at the same kind of embroidery which he had\\noften, often seen before her; Meg, his own dear daughter, was presented\\nto his view.', 'He made no effort to imprint his kisses on her face; he did\\nnot strive to clasp her to his loving heart; he knew that such\\nendearments were, for him, no more.', 'But, he held his trembling breath,\\nand brushed away the blinding tears, that he might look upon her; that he\\nmight only see her.', 'Ah!', 'Changed.', 'Changed.', 'The light of the clear eye, how dimmed.', 'The\\nbloom, how faded from the cheek.', 'Beautiful she was, as she had ever\\nbeen, but Hope, Hope, Hope, oh where was the fresh Hope that had spoken\\nto him like a voice!', 'She looked up from her work, at a companion.', 'Following her eyes, the old\\nman started back.', 'In the woman grown, he recognised her at a glance.', 'In the long silken\\nhair, he saw the self-same curls; around the lips, the child’s expression\\nlingering still.', 'See!', 'In the eyes, now turned inquiringly on Meg, there\\nshone the very look that scanned those features when he brought her home!', 'Then what was this, beside him!', 'Looking with awe into its face, he saw a something reigning there: a\\nlofty something, undefined and indistinct, which made it hardly more than\\na remembrance of that child—as yonder figure might be—yet it was the\\nsame: the same: and wore the dress.', 'Hark.', 'They were speaking!', '‘Meg,’ said Lilian, hesitating.', '‘How often you raise your head from your\\nwork to look at me!’\\n\\n‘Are my looks so altered, that they frighten you?’ asked Meg.', '‘Nay, dear!', 'But you smile at that, yourself!', 'Why not smile, when you\\nlook at me, Meg?’\\n\\n‘I do so.', 'Do I not?’ she answered: smiling on her.', '‘Now you do,’ said Lilian, ‘but not usually.', 'When you think I’m busy,\\nand don’t see you, you look so anxious and so doubtful, that I hardly\\nlike to raise my eyes.', 'There is little cause for smiling in this hard\\nand toilsome life, but you were once so cheerful.’\\n\\n‘Am I not now!’ cried Meg, speaking in a tone of strange alarm, and\\nrising to embrace her.', '‘Do I make our weary life more weary to you,\\nLilian!’\\n\\n‘You have been the only thing that made it life,’ said Lilian, fervently\\nkissing her; ‘sometimes the only thing that made me care to live so, Meg.', 'Such work, such work!', 'So many hours, so many days, so many long, long\\nnights of hopeless, cheerless, never-ending work—not to heap up riches,\\nnot to live grandly or gaily, not to live upon enough, however coarse;\\nbut to earn bare bread; to scrape together just enough to toil upon, and\\nwant upon, and keep alive in us the consciousness of our hard fate!', 'Oh\\nMeg, Meg!’ she raised her voice and twined her arms about her as she\\nspoke, like one in pain.', '‘How can the cruel world go round, and bear to\\nlook upon such lives!’\\n\\n‘Lilly!’ said Meg, soothing her, and putting back her hair from her wet\\nface.', '‘Why, Lilly!', 'You!', 'So pretty and so young!’\\n\\n‘Oh Meg!’ she interrupted, holding her at arm’s-length, and looking in\\nher face imploringly.', '‘The worst of all, the worst of all!', 'Strike me\\nold, Meg!', 'Wither me, and shrivel me, and free me from the dreadful\\nthoughts that tempt me in my youth!’\\n\\nTrotty turned to look upon his guide.', 'But the Spirit of the child had\\ntaken flight.', 'Was gone.', 'Neither did he himself remain in the same place; for, Sir Joseph Bowley,\\nFriend and Father of the Poor, held a great festivity at Bowley Hall, in\\nhonour of the natal day of Lady Bowley.', 'And as Lady Bowley had been born\\non New Year’s Day (which the local newspapers considered an especial\\npointing of the finger of Providence to number One, as Lady Bowley’s\\ndestined figure in Creation), it was on a New Year’s Day that this\\nfestivity took place.', 'Bowley Hall was full of visitors.', 'The red-faced gentleman was there, Mr.\\nFiler was there, the great Alderman Cute was there—Alderman Cute had a\\nsympathetic feeling with great people, and had considerably improved his\\nacquaintance with Sir Joseph Bowley on the strength of his attentive\\nletter: indeed had become quite a friend of the family since then—and\\nmany guests were there.', 'Trotty’s ghost was there, wandering about, poor\\nphantom, drearily; and looking for its guide.', 'There was to be a great dinner in the Great Hall.', 'At which Sir Joseph\\nBowley, in his celebrated character of Friend and Father of the Poor, was\\nto make his great speech.', 'Certain plum-puddings were to be eaten by his\\nFriends and Children in another Hall first; and, at a given signal,\\nFriends and Children flocking in among their Friends and Fathers, were to\\nform a family assemblage, with not one manly eye therein unmoistened by\\nemotion.', 'But, there was more than this to happen.', 'Even more than this.', 'Sir\\nJoseph Bowley, Baronet and Member of Parliament, was to play a match at\\nskittles—real skittles—with his tenants!', '‘Which quite reminds me,’ said Alderman Cute, ‘of the days of old King\\nHal, stout King Hal, bluff King Hal.', 'Ah!', 'Fine character!’\\n\\n‘Very,’ said Mr. Filer, dryly.', '‘For marrying women and murdering ’em.', 'Considerably more than the average number of wives by the bye.’\\n\\n‘You’ll marry the beautiful ladies, and not murder ’em, eh?’ said\\nAlderman Cute to the heir of Bowley, aged twelve.', '‘Sweet boy!', 'We shall\\nhave this little gentleman in Parliament now,’ said the Alderman, holding\\nhim by the shoulders, and looking as reflective as he could, ‘before we\\nknow where we are.', 'We shall hear of his successes at the poll; his\\nspeeches in the House; his overtures from Governments; his brilliant\\nachievements of all kinds; ah!', 'we shall make our little orations about\\nhim in the Common Council, I’ll be bound; before we have time to look\\nabout us!’\\n\\n‘Oh, the difference of shoes and stockings!’ Trotty thought.', 'But his\\nheart yearned towards the child, for the love of those same shoeless and\\nstockingless boys, predestined (by the Alderman) to turn out bad, who\\nmight have been the children of poor Meg.', '‘Richard,’ moaned Trotty, roaming among the company, to and fro; ‘where\\nis he?', 'I can’t find Richard!', 'Where is Richard?’  Not likely to be\\nthere, if still alive!', 'But Trotty’s grief and solitude confused him; and\\nhe still went wandering among the gallant company, looking for his guide,\\nand saying, ‘Where is Richard?', 'Show me Richard!’\\n\\nHe was wandering thus, when he encountered Mr.', 'Fish, the confidential\\nSecretary: in great agitation.', '‘Bless my heart and soul!’ cried Mr.', 'Fish.', '‘Where’s Alderman Cute?', 'Has\\nanybody seen the Alderman?’\\n\\nSeen the Alderman?', 'Oh dear!', 'Who could ever help seeing the Alderman?', 'He was so considerate, so affable, he bore so much in mind the natural\\ndesires of folks to see him, that if he had a fault, it was the being\\nconstantly On View.', 'And wherever the great people were, there, to be\\nsure, attracted by the kindred sympathy between great souls, was Cute.', 'Several voices cried that he was in the circle round Sir Joseph.', 'Mr.', 'Fish made way there; found him; and took him secretly into a window near\\nat hand.', 'Trotty joined them.', 'Not of his own accord.', 'He felt that his\\nsteps were led in that direction.', '‘My dear Alderman Cute,’ said Mr.', 'Fish.', '‘A little more this way.', 'The\\nmost dreadful circumstance has occurred.', 'I have this moment received the\\nintelligence.', 'I think it will be best not to acquaint Sir Joseph with it\\ntill the day is over.', 'You understand Sir Joseph, and will give me your\\nopinion.', 'The most frightful and deplorable event!’\\n\\n‘Fish!’ returned the Alderman.', '‘Fish!', 'My good fellow, what is the\\nmatter?', 'Nothing revolutionary, I hope!', 'No—no attempted

'By his own hand!’\\n\\n‘This very morning,’ returned Mr.', 'Fish.', '‘Oh the brain, the brain!’ exclaimed the pious Alderman, lifting up his\\nhands.', '‘Oh the nerves, the nerves; the mysteries of this machine called\\nMan!', 'Oh the little that unhinges it: poor creatures that we are!', 'Perhaps a dinner, Mr.', 'Fish.', 'Perhaps the conduct of his son, who, I have\\nheard, ran very wild, and was in the habit of drawing bills upon him\\nwithout the least authority!', 'A most respectable man.', 'One of the most\\nrespectable men I ever knew!', 'A lamentable instance, Mr.', 'Fish.', 'A

judgment, when your day shall come!', 'Weigh them, in the\\neyes of suffering thousands, audience (not unmindful) of the grim farce\\nyou play.', 'Or supposing that you strayed from your five wits—it’s not so\\nfar to go, but that it might be—and laid hands upon that throat of yours,\\nwarning your fellows (if you have a fellow) how they croak their\\ncomfortable wickedness to raving heads and stricken hearts.', 'What then?', 'The words rose up in Trotty’s breast, as if they had been spoken by some\\nother voice within him.', 'Alderman Cute pledged himself to Mr.', 'Fish that\\nhe would assist him in breaking the melancholy catastrophe to Sir Joseph\\nwhen the day was over.', 'Then, before they parted, wringing Mr. Fish’s\\nhand in bitterness of soul, he said, ‘The most respectable of men!’  And\\nadded that he hardly knew (not even he), why such afflictions were\\nallowed on earth.', '‘It’s almost enough to make one think, if one didn’t know better,’ said\\nAlderman Cute, ‘that at times some motion of a capsizing nature was going\\non in things, which affected the general economy of the social fabric.', 'Deedles Brothers!’\\n\\nThe skittle-playing came off with immense success.', 'Sir Joseph knocked\\nthe pins about quite skilfully; Master Bowley took an innings at a\\nshorter distance also; and everybody said that now, when a Baronet and\\nthe Son of a Baronet played at skittles, the country was coming round\\nagain, as fast as it could come.', 'At its proper time, the Banquet was served up.', 'Trotty involuntarily\\nrepaired to the Hall with the rest, for he felt himself conducted thither\\nby some stronger impulse than his own free will.', 'The sight was gay in\\nthe extreme; the ladies were very handsome; the visitors delighted,\\ncheerful, and good-tempered.', 'When the lower doors were opened, and the\\npeople flocked in, in their rustic dresses, the beauty of the spectacle\\nwas at its height; but Trotty only murmured more and more, ‘Where is\\nRichard!', 'He should help and comfort her!', 'I can’t see Richard!’\\n\\nThere had been some speeches made; and Lady Bowley’s health had been\\nproposed; and Sir Joseph Bowley had returned thanks, and had made his\\ngreat speech, showing by various pieces of evidence that he was the born\\nFriend and Father, and so forth; and had given as a Toast, his Friends\\nand Children, and the Dignity of Labour; when a slight disturbance at the\\nbottom of the Hall attracted Toby’s notice.', 'After some confusion, noise,\\nand opposition, one man broke through the rest, and stood forward by\\nhimself.', 'Not Richard.', 'No.', 'But one whom he had thought of, and had looked for,\\nmany times.', 'In a scantier supply of light, he might have doubted the\\nidentity of that worn man, so old, and grey, and bent; but with a blaze\\nof lamps upon his gnarled and knotted head, he knew Will Fern as soon as\\nhe stepped forth.', '‘What is this!’ exclaimed Sir Joseph, rising.', '‘Who gave this man\\nadmittance?', 'This is a criminal from prison!', 'Mr.', 'Fish, sir, _will_ you\\nhave the goodness—’\\n\\n‘A minute!’ said Will Fern.', '‘A minute!', 'My Lady, you was born on this\\nday along with a New Year.', 'Get me a minute’s leave to speak.’\\n\\nShe made some intercession for him.', 'Sir Joseph took his seat again, with\\nnative dignity.', 'The ragged visitor—for he was miserably dressed—looked round upon the\\ncompany, and made his homage to them with a humble bow.', '‘Gentlefolks!’ he said.', '‘You’ve drunk the Labourer.', 'Look at me!’\\n\\n‘Just come from jail,’ said Mr.', 'Fish.', '‘Just come from jail,’ said Will.', '‘And neither for the first time, nor\\nthe second, nor the third, nor yet the fourth.’\\n\\nMr. Filer was heard to remark testily, that four times was over the\\naverage; and he ought to be ashamed of himself.', '‘Gentlefolks!’ repeated Will Fern.', '‘Look at me!', 'You see I’m at the\\nworst.', 'Beyond all hurt or harm; beyond your help; for the time when your\\nkind words or kind actions could have done me good,’—he struck his hand\\nupon his breast, and shook his head, ‘is gone, with the scent of last\\nyear’s beans or clover on the air.', 'Let me say a word for these,’\\npointing to the labouring people in the Hall; ‘and when you’re met\\ntogether, hear the real Truth spoke out for once.’\\n\\n‘There’s not a man here,’ said the host, ‘who would have him for a\\nspokesman.’\\n\\n‘Like enough, Sir Joseph.', 'I believe it.', 'Not the less true, perhaps, is\\nwhat I say.', 'Perhaps that’s a proof on it.', 'Gentlefolks, I’ve lived many\\na year in this place.', 'You may see the cottage from the sunk fence over\\nyonder.', 'I’ve seen the ladies draw it in their books, a hundred times.', 'It looks well in a picter, I’ve heerd say; but there an’t weather in\\npicters, and maybe ’tis fitter for that, than for a place to live in.', 'Well!', 'I lived there.', 'How hard—how bitter hard, I lived there, I won’t\\nsay.', 'Any day in the year, and every day, you can judge for your own\\nselves.’\\n\\nHe spoke as he had spoken on the night when Trotty found him in the\\nstreet.', 'His voice was deeper and

an\\nexample: a living example.', 'I hope and trust, and confidently expect,\\nthat it will not be lost upon my Friends here.’\\n\\n‘I dragged on,’ said Fern, after a moment’s silence, ‘somehow.', 'Neither\\nme nor any other man knows how; but so heavy, that I couldn’t put a\\ncheerful face upon it, or make believe that I was anything but what I\\nwas.', 'Now, gentlemen—you gentlemen that sits at Sessions—when you see a\\nman with discontent writ on his face, you says to one another, “He’s\\nsuspicious.', 'I has my doubts,” says you, “about Will Fern.', 'Watch that\\nfellow!”  I don’t say,

'But, another moment showed him that the room and all the\\ncompany had vanished from his sight, and that his daughter was again\\nbefore him, seated at her work.', 'But in a poorer, meaner garret than\\nbefore; and with no Lilian by her side.', 'The frame at which she had worked, was put away upon a shelf and covered\\nup.', 'The chair in which she had sat, was turned against the wall.', 'A\\nhistory was written in these little things, and in Meg’s grief-worn face.', 'Oh!', 'who could fail to read it!', 'Meg strained her eyes upon her work until it was too dark to see the\\nthreads;

her in a\\ntender voice about the old times, and the Bells.', 'Though he knew, poor\\nTrotty, though he knew she could not hear him.', 'A great part of the evening had worn away, when a knock came at her door.', 'She opened it.', 'A man was on the threshold.', 'A slouching, moody, drunken\\nsloven, wasted by intemperance and vice, and with his matted hair and\\nunshorn beard in wild disorder; but, with some traces on him, too, of\\nhaving been a man of good proportion and good features in his youth.', 'He stopped until he had her leave to enter; and she, retiring a pace or\\ntwo from the open door, silently and sorrowfully looked upon him.', 'Trotty\\nhad his wish.', 'He saw Richard.', '‘May I come in, Margaret?’\\n\\n‘Yes!', 'Come in.', 'Come in!’\\n\\nIt was well that Trotty knew him before he spoke; for with any doubt\\nremaining on his mind, the harsh discordant voice would have persuaded\\nhim that it was not Richard but some other man.', 'There were but two chairs in the room.', 'She gave him hers, and stood at\\nsome short distance from him, waiting to hear what he had to say.', 'He sat, however, staring vacantly at the floor; with a lustreless and\\nstupid smile.', 'A spectacle of such deep degradation, of such abject\\nhopelessness, of such a miserable downfall, that she put her hands before\\nher face and turned away, lest he should see how much it moved her.', 'Roused by the rustling of her dress, or some such trifling sound, he\\nlifted his head, and began to speak as if there had been no pause since\\nhe entered.', '‘Still at work, Margaret?', 'You work late.’\\n\\n‘I generally do.’\\n\\n‘And early?’\\n\\n‘And early.’\\n\\n‘So she said.', 'She said you never tired; or never owned that you tired.', 'Not all the time you lived together.', 'Not

'That if I died\\nto-morrow, I would remember her with my last breath.', 'But, that I cannot\\nlook upon it!’\\n\\nHe slowly recalled his hand, and crushing the purse together, said with a\\nkind of drowsy thoughtfulness:\\n\\n‘I told her so.', 'I told her so, as plain as words could speak.', 'I’ve\\ntaken this gift back and left it at her door, a dozen times since then.', 'But when she came at last, and stood before me, face to face, what could\\nI do?’\\n\\n‘You saw her!’ exclaimed Meg.', '‘You saw her!', 'O, Lilian, my sweet girl!', 'O, Lilian, Lilian!’\\n\\n‘I saw her,’ he went on to say, not answering, but engaged in the same\\nslow pursuit of his own thoughts.', '‘There she stood: trembling!', '“How\\ndoes she look, Richard?', 'Does she ever speak of me?', 'Is she thinner?', 'My\\nold place at the table: what’s in my old place?', 'And the frame she taught\\nme our old work on—has she burnt it, Richard!”  There she was.', 'I heard\\nher say it.’\\n\\nMeg checked her sobs, and with the tears streaming from her eyes, bent\\nover him to listen.', 'Not to lose a breath.', 'With his arms resting on his knees; and stooping forward in his chair, as\\nif what he said were written on the ground in some half legible\\ncharacter, which it was his occupation to decipher and connect; he went\\non.', '‘“Richard, I have fallen very low; and you may guess how much I have\\nsuffered in having this sent back, when I can bear to bring it in my hand\\nto you.', 'But you loved her once, even in my memory, dearly.', 'Others\\nstepped in between you; fears, and jealousies, and doubts, and vanities,\\nestranged you from her; but you did love her, even in my memory!”  I\\nsuppose I did,’ he said, interrupting himself for a moment.', '‘I did!', 'That’s neither here nor there—“O Richard, if you ever did; if you have\\nany memory for what is gone and lost, take it to her once more.', 'Once\\nmore!', 'Tell her how I laid my head upon your shoulder, where her own head\\nmight have lain, and was so humble to you, Richard.', 'Tell her that you\\nlooked into my face, and saw the beauty which she used to praise, all\\ngone: all gone: and in its place, a poor, wan, hollow cheek, that she\\nwould weep to see.', 'Tell her everything, and take it back, and she will\\nnot refuse again.', 'She will not have the heart!”’\\n\\nSo he sat musing, and repeating the last words, until he woke again, and\\nrose.', '‘You won’t take it, Margaret?’\\n\\nShe shook her head, and motioned an entreaty to him to leave her.', '‘Good night, Margaret.’\\n\\n‘Good night!’\\n\\nHe turned to look upon her; struck by her sorrow, and perhaps by the pity\\nfor himself which trembled in her voice.', 'It was a quick and rapid\\naction; and for the moment some flash of his old bearing kindled in his\\nform.', 'In the next he went as he had come.', 'Nor did this glimmer of a\\nquenched fire seem to light him to a quicker sense of his debasement.', 'In any mood, in any grief, in any torture of the mind or body, Meg’s work\\nmust be done.', 'She sat down to her task, and plied it.', 'Night, midnight.', 'Still she worked.', 'She had a meagre fire, the night being very cold; and rose at intervals\\nto mend it.', 'The Chimes rang half-past twelve while she was thus engaged;\\nand when they ceased she heard a gentle knocking at the door.', 'Before she\\ncould so much as wonder who was there, at that unusual hour, it opened.', 'O Youth and Beauty, happy as ye should be, look at this.', 'O Youth and\\nBeauty, blest and blessing all within your reach, and working out the\\nends of your Beneficent Creator, look at this!', 'She saw the entering figure; screamed its name; cried ‘Lilian!’\\n\\nIt was swift, and fell upon its knees before her: clinging to her dress.', '‘Up, dear!', 'Up!', 'Lilian!', 'My own dearest!’\\n\\n‘Never more, Meg; never more!', 'Here!', 'Here!', 'Close to you, holding to\\nyou, feeling your dear breath upon my face!’\\n\\n‘Sweet Lilian!', 'Darling Lilian!', 'Child of my heart—no mother’s love can\\nbe more tender—lay your head upon my breast!’\\n\\n‘Never more, Meg.', 'Never more!', 'When I first looked into your face, you\\nknelt before me.', 'On my knees before you, let me die.', 'Let it be here!’\\n\\n‘You have come back.', 'My Treasure!', 'We will live together, work together,\\nhope together, die together!’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'Kiss my lips, Meg; fold your arms about me; press me to your bosom;\\nlook kindly on me; but don’t raise me.', 'Let it be here.', 'Let me see the\\nlast of your dear face upon my knees!’\\n\\nO Youth and Beauty, happy as ye should be, look at this!', 'O Youth and\\nBeauty, working out the ends of your Beneficent Creator, look at this!', '‘Forgive me, Meg!', 'So dear, so dear!', 'Forgive me!', 'I know you do, I see\\nyou do, but say so, Meg!’\\n\\nShe said so, with her lips on Lilian’s cheek.', 'And with her arms twined\\nround—she knew it now—a broken heart.', '‘His blessing on you, dearest love.', 'Kiss me once more!', 'He suffered her\\nto sit beside His feet, and dry them with her hair.', 'O Meg, what Mercy\\nand Compassion!’\\n\\nAs she died, the Spirit of the child returning, innocent and radiant,\\ntouched the old man with its hand, and beckoned him away.', 'CHAPTER IV—Fourth Quarter.', 'Some new remembrance of the ghostly figures in the Bells; some faint\\nimpression of the ringing of the Chimes; some giddy consciousness of\\nhaving seen the swarm of phantoms reproduced and reproduced until the\\nrecollection of them lost itself in the confusion of their numbers; some\\nhurried knowledge, how conveyed to him he knew not, that more years had\\npassed; and Trotty, with the Spirit of the child attending him, stood\\nlooking on at mortal company.', 'Fat company, rosy-cheeked company, comfortable company.', 'They were but\\ntwo, but they were red enough for ten.', 'They sat before a bright fire,\\nwith a small low table between them; and unless the fragrance of hot tea\\nand muffins lingered longer in that room than in most others, the table\\nhad seen service very lately.', 'But all the cups and saucers being clean,\\nand in their proper places in the corner-cupboard; and the brass\\ntoasting-fork hanging in its usual nook and spreading its four idle\\nfingers out as if it wanted to be measured for a glove; there remained no\\nother visible tokens of the meal just finished, than such as purred and\\nwashed their whiskers in the person of the basking cat, and glistened in\\nthe gracious, not to say the greasy, faces of her patrons.', 'This cosy couple (married, evidently) had made a fair division of the\\nfire between them, and sat looking at the glowing sparks that dropped\\ninto the grate; now nodding off into a doze; now waking up again when\\nsome hot fragment, larger than the rest, came rattling down, as if the\\nfire were coming with it.', 'It was in no danger of sudden extinction, however; for it gleamed not\\nonly in the little room, and on the panes of window-glass in the door,\\nand on the curtain half drawn across them, but in the little shop beyond.', 'A little shop, quite crammed and choked with the abundance of its stock;\\na perfectly voracious little shop, with a maw as accommodating and full\\nas any shark’s.', 'Cheese, butter, firewood, soap, pickles, matches, bacon,\\ntable-beer, peg-tops, sweetmeats, boys’ kites, bird-seed, cold ham, birch\\nbrooms, hearth-stones, salt, vinegar, blacking, red-herrings, stationery,\\nlard, mushroom-ketchup, staylaces, loaves of bread, shuttlecocks, eggs,\\nand slate pencil; everything was fish that came to the net of this greedy\\nlittle shop, and all articles were in its net.', 'How many other kinds of\\npetty merchandise were there, it would be difficult to say; but balls of\\npackthread, ropes of onions, pounds of candles, cabbage-nets, and\\nbrushes, hung in bunches from the ceiling, like extraordinary fruit;\\nwhile various odd canisters emitting aromatic smells, established the\\nveracity of the inscription over the outer door, which informed the\\npublic that the keeper of this little shop was a licensed dealer in tea,\\ncoffee, tobacco, pepper, and snuff.', 'Glancing at such of these articles as were visible in the shining of the\\nblaze, and the less cheerful radiance of two smoky lamps which burnt but\\ndimly in the shop itself, as though its plethora sat heavy on their\\nlungs; and glancing, then, at one of the two faces by the parlour-fire;\\nTrotty had small difficulty in recognising in the stout old lady, Mrs.\\nChickenstalker: always inclined to corpulency, even in the days when he\\nhad known her as established in the general line, and having a small\\nbalance against him in her books.', 'The features of her companion were less easy to him.', 'The great broad\\nchin, with creases in it large enough to hide a finger in; the astonished\\neyes, that seemed to expostulate with themselves for sinking deeper and\\ndeeper into the yielding fat of the soft face; the nose afflicted with\\nthat disordered action of its functions which is generally termed The\\nSnuffles; the short thick throat and labouring chest, with other beauties\\nof the like description; though calculated to impress the memory, Trotty\\ncould at first allot to nobody he had ever known: and yet he had some\\nrecollection of them too.', 'At length, in Mrs. Chickenstalker’s partner in\\nthe general line, and in the crooked and eccentric line of life, he\\nrecognised the former porter of Sir Joseph Bowley; an apoplectic\\ninnocent, who had connected himself in Trotty’s mind with Mrs.\\nChickenstalker years ago, by giving him admission to the mansion where he\\nhad confessed his obligations to that lady, and drawn on his unlucky head\\nsuch grave reproach.', 'Trotty had little interest in a change like this, after the changes he\\nhad seen; but association is very strong sometimes; and he looked\\ninvoluntarily behind the parlour-door, where the accounts of credit\\ncustomers were usually kept in chalk.', 'There was no record of his name.', 'Some names were there, but they were strange to him, and infinitely fewer\\nthan of old; from which he argued that the porter was an advocate of\\nready-money transactions, and on coming into the business had looked\\npretty sharp after the Chickenstalker defaulters.', 'So desolate was Trotty, and so mournful for the youth and promise of his\\nblighted child, that it was a sorrow to him, even to have no place in\\nMrs. Chickenstalker’s ledger.', '‘What sort of a night is it, Anne?’ inquired the former porter of Sir\\nJoseph Bowley, stretching out his legs before the fire, and rubbing as\\nmuch of them as his short arms could reach; with an air that added, ‘Here\\nI am if it’s bad, and I don’t want to go out if it’s good.’\\n\\n‘Blowing and sleeting hard,’ returned his wife; ‘and threatening snow.', 'Dark.', 'And very cold.’\\n\\n‘I’m glad to think we had muffins,’ said the former porter, in the tone\\nof one who had set his conscience at rest.', '‘It’s a sort of night that’s\\nmeant for muffins.', 'Likewise crumpets.', 'Also Sally Lunns.’\\n\\nThe former porter mentioned each successive kind of eatable, as if he\\nwere musingly summing up his good actions.', 'After which he rubbed his fat\\nlegs as before, and jerking them at the knees to get the fire upon the\\nyet unroasted parts, laughed as if somebody had tickled him.', '‘You’re in spirits, Tugby, my dear,’ observed his wife.', 'The firm was Tugby, late Chickenstalker.', '‘No,’ said Tugby.', '‘No.', 'Not particular.', 'I’m a little elewated.', 'The\\nmuffins came so pat!’\\n\\nWith that he chuckled until he was black in the face; and had so much ado\\nto become any other colour, that his fat legs took the strangest\\nexcursions into the air.', 'Nor were they reduced to anything like decorum\\nuntil Mrs. Tugby had thumped him violently on the back, and shaken him as\\nif he were a great bottle.', '‘Good gracious, goodness, lord-a-mercy bless and save the man!’ cried\\nMrs. Tugby, in great terror.', '‘What’s he doing?’\\n\\nMr. Tugby wiped his eyes, and faintly repeated that he found himself a\\nlittle elewated.', '‘Then don’t be so again, that’s a dear good soul,’ said Mrs. Tugby, ‘if\\nyou don’t want to frighten me to death, with your struggling and\\nfighting!’\\n\\nMr. Tugby said he wouldn’t; but, his whole existence was a fight, in\\nwhich, if any judgment might be founded on the constantly-increasing\\nshortness of his breath, and the deepening purple of his face, he was\\nalways getting the worst of it.', '‘So it’s blowing, and sleeting, and threatening snow; and it’s dark, and\\nvery cold, is it, my dear?’ said Mr. Tugby, looking at the fire, and\\nreverting to the cream and marrow of his temporary elevation.', '‘Hard weather indeed,’ returned his wife, shaking her head.', '‘Aye, aye!', 'Years,’ said Mr. Tugby, ‘are like Christians in that respect.', 'Some of ’em die hard; some of ’em die easy.', 'This one hasn’t many days to\\nrun, and is making a fight for it.', 'I like him all the better.', 'There’s a\\ncustomer, my love!’\\n\\nAttentive to the rattling door, Mrs. Tugby had already risen.', '‘Now then!’ said that lady, passing out into the little shop.', '‘What’s\\nwanted?', 'Oh!', 'I beg your pardon, sir, I’m sure.', 'I didn’t think it was\\nyou.’\\n\\nShe made this apology to a gentleman in black, who, with his wristbands\\ntucked up, and his hat cocked loungingly on one side, and his hands in\\nhis pockets, sat down astride on the table-beer barrel, and nodded in\\nreturn.', '‘This is a bad business up-stairs, Mrs. Tugby,’ said the gentleman.', '‘The\\nman can’t live.’\\n\\n‘Not the back-attic can’t!’ cried Tugby, coming out into the shop to join\\nthe conference.', '‘The back-attic, Mr. Tugby,’ said the gentleman, ‘is coming down-stairs\\nfast, and will be below the basement very soon.’\\n\\nLooking by turns at Tugby and his wife, he sounded the barrel with his\\nknuckles for the depth of beer, and having found it, played a tune upon\\nthe empty part.', '‘The back-attic, Mr. Tugby,’ said the gentleman: Tugby having stood in\\nsilent consternation for some time: ‘is Going.’\\n\\n‘Then,’ said Tugby, turning to his wife, ‘he must Go, you know, before\\nhe’s Gone.’\\n\\n‘I don’t think you can move him,’ said the gentleman, shaking his head.', '‘I wouldn’t take the responsibility of saying it could be done, myself.', 'You had better leave him where he is.', 'He can’t live long.’\\n\\n‘It’s the only subject,’ said Tugby, bringing the butter-scale down upon\\nthe counter with a crash, by weighing his fist on it, ‘that we’ve ever\\nhad a word upon; she and me; and look what it comes to!', 'He’s going to\\ndie here, after all.', 'Going to die upon the premises.', 'Going to die in\\nour house!’\\n\\n‘And where should he have died, Tugby?’ cried his wife.', '‘In the workhouse,’ he returned.', '‘What are workhouses made for?’\\n\\n‘Not for that,’ said Mrs. Tugby, with great energy.', '‘Not for that!', 'Neither did I marry you for that.', 'Don’t think it, Tugby.', 'I won’t have\\nit.', 'I won’t allow it.', 'I’d be separated first, and never see your face\\nagain.', 'When my widow’s name stood over that door, as it did for many\\nyears: this house being known as Mrs. Chickenstalker’s far and wide, and\\nnever known but to its honest credit and its good report: when my widow’s\\nname stood over that door, Tugby, I knew him as a handsome, steady,\\nmanly, independent youth; I knew her as the sweetest-looking,\\nsweetest-tempered girl, eyes ever saw; I knew her father (poor old\\ncreetur, he fell down from the steeple walking in his sleep, and killed\\nhimself), for the simplest, hardest-working, childest-hearted man, that\\never drew the breath of life; and when I turn them out of house and home,\\nmay angels turn me out of Heaven.', 'As they would!', 'And serve me right!’\\n\\nHer old face, which had been a plump and dimpled one before the changes\\nwhich had come to pass, seemed to shine out of her as she said these\\nwords; and when she dried her eyes, and shook her head and her\\nhandkerchief at Tugby, with an expression of firmness which it was quite\\nclear was not to be easily resisted, Trotty said, ‘Bless her!', 'Bless\\nher!’\\n\\nThen he listened, with a panting heart, for what should follow.', 'Knowing\\nnothing yet, but that they spoke of Meg.', 'If Tugby had been a little elevated in the parlour, he more than balanced\\nthat account by being not a little depressed in the shop, where he now\\nstood staring at his wife, without attempting a reply; secretly\\nconveying, however—either in a fit of abstraction or as a precautionary\\nmeasure—all the money from the till into his own pockets, as he looked at\\nher.', 'The gentleman upon the table-beer cask, who appeared to be some\\nauthorised medical attendant upon the poor, was far too well accustomed,\\nevidently, to little differences of opinion between man and wife, to\\ninterpose any remark in this instance.', 'He sat softly whistling, and\\nturning little drops of beer out of the tap upon the ground, until there\\nwas a perfect calm: when he raised his head, and said to Mrs. Tugby, late\\nChickenstalker:\\n\\n‘There’s something interesting about the woman, even now.', 'How did she\\ncome to marry him?’\\n\\n‘Why that,’ said Mrs. Tugby, taking a seat near him, ‘is not the least\\ncruel part of her story, sir.', 'You see they kept company, she and\\nRichard, many years ago.', 'When they were a young and beautiful couple,\\neverything was settled, and they were to have been married on a New\\nYear’s Day.', 'But, somehow, Richard got it into his head, through what the\\ngentlemen told him, that he might do better, and that he’d soon repent\\nit, and that she wasn’t good enough for him, and that a young man of\\nspirit had no business to be married.', 'And the gentlemen frightened her,\\nand made her melancholy, and timid of his deserting her, and of her\\nchildren coming to the gallows, and of its being wicked to be man and\\nwife, and a good deal more of it.', 'And in short, they lingered and\\nlingered, and their trust in one another was broken, and so at last was\\nthe match.', 'But the fault was his.', 'She would have married him, sir,\\njoyfully.', 'I’ve seen her heart swell many times afterwards, when he\\npassed her in a proud and careless way; and never did a woman grieve more\\ntruly for a man, than she for Richard when he first went wrong.’\\n\\n‘Oh!', 'he went wrong, did he?’ said the gentleman, pulling out the vent-peg\\nof the table-beer, and trying to peep down into the barrel through the\\nhole.', '‘Well, sir, I don’t know that he rightly understood himself, you see.', 'I\\nthink his mind was troubled by their having broke with one another; and\\nthat but for being ashamed before the gentlemen, and perhaps for being\\nuncertain too, how she might take it, he’d have gone through any\\nsuffering or trial to have had Meg’s promise and Meg’s hand again.', 'That’s my belief.', 'He never said so; more’s the pity!', 'He took to\\ndrinking, idling, bad companions: all the fine resources that were to be\\nso much better for him than the Home he might have had.', 'He lost his\\nlooks, his character, his health, his strength, his friends, his work:\\neverything!’\\n\\n‘He didn’t lose everything, Mrs. Tugby,’ returned the gentleman, ‘because\\nhe gained a wife; and I want to know how he gained her.’\\n\\n‘I’m coming to it, sir, in a moment.', 'This went on for years and years;\\nhe sinking lower and lower; she enduring, poor thing, miseries enough to\\nwear her life away.', 'At last, he was so cast down, and cast out, that no\\none would employ or notice him; and doors were shut upon him, go where he\\nwould.', 'Applying from place to place, and door to door; and coming for\\nthe hundredth time to one gentleman who had often and often tried him (he\\nwas a good workman to the very end); that gentleman, who knew his\\nhistory, said, “I believe you are incorrigible; there is only one person\\nin the world who has a chance of reclaiming you; ask me to trust you no\\nmore, until she tries to do it.”  Something like that, in his anger and\\nvexation.’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ said the gentleman.', '‘Well?’\\n\\n‘Well, sir, he went to her, and kneeled to her; said it was so; said it\\never had been so; and made a prayer to her to save him.’\\n\\n‘And she?—Don’t distress yourself, Mrs. Tugby.’\\n\\n‘She came to me that night to ask me about living here.', '“What he was\\nonce to me,” she said, “is buried in a grave, side by side with what I\\nwas to him.', 'But I have thought of this; and I will make the trial.', 'In\\nthe hope of saving him; for the love of the light-hearted girl (you\\nremember her) who was to have been married on a New Year’s Day; and for\\nthe love of her Richard.”  And she said he had come to her from Lilian,\\nand Lilian had trusted to him, and she never could forget that.', 'So they\\nwere married; and when they came home here, and I saw them, I hoped that\\nsuch prophecies as parted them when they were young, may not often fulfil\\nthemselves as they did in this case, or I wouldn’t be the makers of them\\nfor a Mine of Gold.’\\n\\nThe gentleman got off the cask, and stretched himself, observing:\\n\\n‘I suppose he used her ill, as soon as they were married?’\\n\\n‘I don’t think he ever did that,’ said Mrs. Tugby, shaking her head, and\\nwiping her eyes.', '‘He went on better for a short time; but, his habits\\nwere too old and strong to be got rid of; he soon fell back a little; and\\nwas falling fast back, when his illness came so strong upon him.', 'I think\\nhe has always felt for her.', 'I am sure he has.', 'I have seen him, in his\\ncrying fits and tremblings, try to kiss her hand; and I have heard him\\ncall her “Meg,” and say it was her nineteenth birthday.', 'There he has\\nbeen lying, now, these weeks and months.', 'Between him and her baby, she\\nhas not been able to do her old work; and by not being able to be\\nregular, she has lost it, even if she could have done it.', 'How they have\\nlived, I hardly know!’\\n\\n‘I know,’ muttered Mr. Tugby; looking at the till, and round the shop,\\nand at his wife; and rolling his head with immense intelligence.', '‘Like\\nFighting Cocks!’\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a cry—a sound of lamentation—from the upper story\\nof the house.', 'The gentleman moved hurriedly to the door.', '‘My friend,’ he said, looking back, ‘you needn’t discuss whether he shall\\nbe removed or not.', 'He has spared you that trouble, I believe.’\\n\\nSaying so, he ran up-stairs, followed by Mrs. Tugby; while Mr. Tugby\\npanted and grumbled after them at leisure: being rendered more than\\ncommonly short-winded by the weight of the till, in which there had been\\nan inconvenient quantity of copper.', 'Trotty, with the child beside him,\\nfloated up the staircase like mere air.', '‘Follow her!', 'Follow her!', 'Follow her!’  He heard the ghostly voices in\\nthe Bells repeat their words as he ascended.', '‘Learn it, from the\\ncreature dearest to your heart!’\\n\\nIt was over.', 'It was over.', 'And this was she, her father’s pride and joy!', 'This haggard, wretched woman, weeping by the bed, if it deserved that\\nname, and pressing to her breast, and hanging down her head upon, an\\ninfant.', 'Who can tell how spare, how sickly, and how poor an infant!', 'Who\\ncan tell how dear!', '‘Thank God!’ cried Trotty, holding up his folded hands.', '‘O, God be\\nthanked!', 'She loves her child!’\\n\\nThe gentleman, not otherwise hard-hearted or indifferent to such scenes,\\nthan that he saw them every day, and knew that they were figures of no\\nmoment in the Filer sums—mere scratches in the working of these\\ncalculations—laid his hand upon the heart that beat no more, and listened\\nfor the breath, and said, ‘His pain is over.', 'It’s better as it is!’\\nMrs. Tugby tried to comfort her with kindness.', 'Mr. Tugby tried\\nphilosophy.', '‘Come, come!’ he said, with his hands in his pockets, ‘you mustn’t give\\nway, you know.', 'That won’t do.', 'You must fight up.', 'What would have\\nbecome of me if _I_ had given way when I was porter, and we had as many\\nas six runaway carriage-doubles at our door in one night!', 'But, I fell\\nback upon my strength of mind, and didn’t open it!’\\n\\nAgain Trotty heard the voices saying, ‘Follow her!’  He turned towards\\nhis guide, and saw it rising from him, passing through the air.', '‘Follow\\nher!’ it said.', 'And vanished.', 'He hovered round her; sat down at her feet; looked up into her face for\\none trace of her old self; listened for one note of her old pleasant\\nvoice.', 'He flitted round the child: so wan, so prematurely old, so\\ndreadful in its gravity, so plaintive in its feeble, mournful, miserable\\nwail.', 'He almost worshipped it.', 'He clung to it as her only safeguard; as\\nthe last unbroken link that bound her to endurance.', 'He set his father’s\\nhope and trust on the frail baby; watched her every look upon it as she\\nheld it in her arms; and cried a thousand times, ‘She loves it!', 'God be\\nthanked, she loves it!’\\n\\nHe saw the woman tend her in the night; return to her when her grudging\\nhusband was asleep, and all was still; encourage her, shed tears with\\nher, set nourishment before her.', 'He saw the day come, and the night\\nagain; the day, the night; the time go by; the house of death relieved of\\ndeath; the room left to herself and to the child; he heard it moan and\\ncry; he saw it harass her, and tire her out, and when she slumbered in\\nexhaustion, drag her back to consciousness, and hold her with its little\\nhands upon the rack; but she was constant to it, gentle with it, patient\\nwith it.', 'Patient!', 'Was its loving mother in her inmost heart and soul,\\nand had its Being knitted up with hers as when she carried it unborn.', 'All this time, she was in want: languishing away, in dire and pining\\nwant.', 'With the baby in her arms, she wandered here and there, in quest\\nof occupation; and with its thin face lying in her lap, and looking up in\\nhers, did any work for any wretched sum; a day and night of labour for as\\nmany farthings as there were figures on the dial.', 'If she had quarrelled\\nwith it; if she had neglected it; if she had looked upon it with a\\nmoment’s hate; if, in the frenzy of an instant, she had struck it!', 'No.', 'His comfort was, She loved it always.', 'She told no one of her extremity, and wandered abroad in the day lest she\\nshould be questioned by her only friend: for any help she received from\\nher hands, occasioned fresh disputes between the good woman and her\\nhusband; and it was new bitterness to be the daily cause of strife and\\ndiscord, where she owed so much.', 'She loved it still.', 'She loved it more and more.', 'But a change fell on\\nthe aspect of her love.', 'One night.', 'She was singing faintly to it in its sleep, and walking to and fro to\\nhush it, when her door was softly opened, and a man looked in.', '‘For the last time,’ he said.', '‘William Fern!’\\n\\n‘For the last time.’\\n\\nHe listened like a man pursued: and spoke in whispers.', '‘Margaret, my race is nearly run.', 'I couldn’t finish it, without a\\nparting word with you.', 'Without one grateful word.’\\n\\n‘What have you done?’ she asked: regarding him with terror.', 'He looked at her, but gave no answer.', 'After a short silence, he made a gesture with his hand, as if he set her\\nquestion by; as if he brushed it aside; and said:\\n\\n‘It’s long ago, Margaret, now: but that night is as fresh in my memory as\\never ’twas.', 'We little thought, then,’ he added, looking round, ‘that we\\nshould ever meet like this.', 'Your child, Margaret?', 'Let me have it in my\\narms.', 'Let me hold your child.’\\n\\nHe put his hat upon the floor, and took it.', 'And he trembled as he took\\nit, from head to foot.', '‘Is it a girl?’\\n\\n‘Yes.’\\n\\nHe put his hand before its little face.', '‘See how weak I’m grown, Margaret, when I want the courage to look at it!', 'Let her be, a moment.', 'I won’t hurt her.', 'It’s long ago, but—What’s her\\nname?’\\n\\n‘Margaret,’ she answered, quickly.', '‘I’m glad of that,’ he said.', '‘I’m glad of that!’  He seemed to breathe\\nmore freely; and after pausing for an instant, took away his hand, and\\nlooked upon the infant’s face.', 'But covered it again, immediately.', '‘Margaret!’ he said; and gave her back the child.', '‘It’s Lilian’s.’\\n\\n‘Lilian’s!’\\n\\n‘I held the same face in my arms when Lilian’s mother died and left her.’\\n\\n‘When Lilian’s mother died and left her!’ she repeated, wildly.', '‘How shrill you speak!', 'Why do you fix your eyes upon me so?', 'Margaret!’\\n\\nShe sunk down in a chair, and pressed the infant to her breast, and wept\\nover it.', 'Sometimes, she released it from her embrace, to look anxiously\\nin its face: then strained it to her bosom again.', 'At those times, when\\nshe gazed upon it, then it was that something fierce and terrible began\\nto mingle with her love.', 'Then it was that her old father quailed.', '‘Follow her!’ was sounded through the house.', '‘Learn it, from the\\ncreature dearest to your heart!’\\n\\n‘Margaret,’ said Fern, bending over her, and kissing her upon the brow:\\n‘I thank you for the last time.', 'Good night.', 'Good bye!', 'Put your hand in\\nmine, and tell me you’ll forget me from this hour, and try to think the\\nend of me was here.’\\n\\n‘What have you done?’ she asked again.', '‘There’ll be a Fire to-night,’ he said, removing from her.', '‘There’ll be\\nFires this winter-time, to light the dark nights, East, West, North, and\\nSouth.', 'When you see the distant sky red, they’ll be blazing.', 'When you\\nsee the distant sky red, think of me no more; or, if you do, remember\\nwhat a Hell was lighted up inside of me, and think you see its flames\\nreflected in the clouds.', 'Good night.', 'Good bye!’  She called to him; but\\nhe was gone.', 'She sat down stupefied, until her infant roused her to a\\nsense of hunger, cold, and darkness.', 'She paced the room with it the\\nlivelong night, hushing it and soothing it.', 'She said at intervals, ‘Like\\nLilian, when her mother died and left her!’  Why was her step so quick,\\nher eye so wild, her love so fierce and terrible, whenever she repeated\\nthose words?', '‘But, it is Love,’ said Trotty.', '‘It is Love.', 'She’ll never cease to love\\nit.', 'My poor Meg!’\\n\\nShe dressed the child next morning with unusual care—ah, vain expenditure\\nof care upon such squalid robes!—and once more tried to find some means\\nof life.', 'It was the last day of the Old Year.', 'She tried till night, and\\nnever broke her fast.', 'She tried in vain.', 'She mingled with an abject crowd, who tarried in the snow, until it\\npleased some officer appointed to dispense the public charity (the lawful\\ncharity; not that once preached upon a Mount), to call them in, and\\nquestion them, and say to this one, ‘Go to such a place,’ to that one,\\n‘Come next week;’ to make a football of another wretch, and pass him here\\nand there, from hand to hand, from house to house, until he wearied and\\nlay down to die; or started up and robbed, and so became a higher sort of\\ncriminal, whose claims allowed of no delay.', 'Here, too, she failed.', 'She loved her child, and wished to have it lying on her breast.', 'And that\\nwas quite enough.', 'It was night: a bleak, dark, cutting night: when, pressing the child\\nclose to her for warmth, she arrived outside the house she called her\\nhome.', 'She was so faint and giddy, that she saw no one standing in the\\ndoorway until she was close upon it, and about to enter.', 'Then, she\\nrecognised the master of the house, who had so disposed himself—with his\\nperson it was not difficult—as to fill up the whole entry.', '‘O!’ he said softly.', '‘You have come back?’\\n\\nShe looked at the child, and shook her head.', '‘Don’t you think you have lived here long enough without paying any rent?', 'Don’t you think that, without any money, you’ve been a pretty constant\\ncustomer at this shop, now?’ said Mr. Tugby.', 'She repeated the same mute appeal.', '‘Suppose you try and deal somewhere else,’ he said.', '‘And suppose you\\nprovide yourself with another lodging.', 'Come!', 'Don’t you think you could\\nmanage it?’\\n\\nShe said in a low voice, that it was very late.', 'To-morrow.', '‘Now I see what you want,’ said Tugby; ‘and what you mean.', 'You know\\nthere are two parties in this house about you, and you delight in setting\\n’em by the ears.', 'I don’t want any quarrels; I’m speaking softly to avoid\\na quarrel; but if you don’t go away, I’ll speak out loud, and you shall\\ncause words high enough to please you.', 'But you shan’t come in.', 'That I\\nam determined.’\\n\\nShe put her hair back with her hand, and looked in a sudden manner at the\\nsky, and the dark lowering distance.', '‘This is the last night of an Old Year, and I won’t carry ill-blood and\\nquarrellings and disturbances into a New One, to please you nor anybody\\nelse,’ said Tugby, who was quite a retail Friend and Father.', '‘I wonder\\nyou an’t ashamed of yourself, to carry such practices into a New Year.', 'If you haven’t any business in the world, but to be always giving way,\\nand always making disturbances between man and wife, you’d be better out\\nof it.', 'Go along with you.’\\n\\n‘Follow her!', 'To desperation!’\\n\\nAgain the old man heard the voices.', 'Looking up, he saw the figures\\nhovering in the air, and pointing where she went, down the dark street.', '‘She loves it!’ he exclaimed, in agonised entreaty for her.', '‘Chimes!', 'she\\nloves it still!’\\n\\n‘Follow her!’  The shadow swept upon the track she had taken, like a\\ncloud.', 'He joined in the pursuit; he kept close to her; he looked into her face.', 'He saw the same fierce and terrible expression mingling with her love,\\nand kindling in her eyes.', 'He heard her say, ‘Like Lilian!', 'To be changed\\nlike Lilian!’ and her speed redoubled.', 'O, for something to awaken her!', 'For any sight, or sound, or scent, to\\ncall up tender recollections in a brain on fire!', 'For any gentle image of\\nthe Past, to rise before her!', '‘I was her father!', 'I was her father!’ cried the old man, stretching out\\nhis hands to the dark shadows flying on above.', '‘Have mercy on her, and\\non me!', 'Where does she go?', 'Turn her back!', 'I was her father!’\\n\\nBut they only pointed to her, as she hurried on; and said, ‘To\\ndesperation!', 'Learn it from the creature dearest to your heart!’  A\\nhundred voices echoed it.', 'The air was made of breath expended in those\\nwords.', 'He seemed to take them in, at every gasp he drew.', 'They were\\neverywhere, and not to be escaped.', 'And still she hurried on; the same\\nlight in her eyes, the same words in her mouth, ‘Like Lilian!', 'To be\\nchanged like Lilian!’  All at once she stopped.', '‘Now, turn her back!’ exclaimed the old man, tearing his white hair.', '‘My\\nchild!', 'Meg!', 'Turn her back!', 'Great Father, turn her back!’\\n\\nIn her own scanty shawl, she wrapped the baby warm.', 'With her fevered\\nhands, she smoothed its limbs, composed its face, arranged its mean\\nattire.', 'In her wasted arms she folded it, as though she never would\\nresign it more.', 'And with her dry lips, kissed it in a final pang, and\\nlast long agony of Love.', 'Putting its tiny hand up to her neck, and holding it there, within her\\ndress, next to her distracted heart, she set its sleeping face against\\nher: closely, steadily, against her: and sped onward to the River.', 'To the rolling River, swift and dim, where Winter Night sat brooding like\\nthe last dark thoughts of many who had sought a refuge there before her.', 'Where scattered lights upon the banks gleamed sullen, red, and dull, as\\ntorches that were burning there, to show the way to Death.', 'Where no\\nabode of living people cast its shadow, on the deep, impenetrable,\\nmelancholy shade.', 'To the River!', 'To that portal of Eternity, her desperate footsteps tended\\nwith the swiftness of its rapid waters running to the sea.', 'He tried to\\ntouch her as she passed him, going down to its dark level: but, the wild\\ndistempered form, the fierce and terrible love, the desperation that had\\nleft all human check or hold behind, swept by him like the wind.', 'He followed her.', 'She paused a moment on the brink, before the dreadful\\nplunge.', 'He fell down on his knees, and in a shriek addressed the figures\\nin the Bells now hovering above them.', '‘I have learnt it!’ cried the old man.', '‘From the creature dearest to my\\nheart!', 'O, save her, save her!’\\n\\nHe could wind his fingers in her dress; could hold it!', 'As the words\\nescaped his lips, he felt his sense of touch return, and knew that he\\ndetained her.', 'The figures looked down steadfastly upon him.', '‘I have learnt it!’ cried the old man.', '‘O, have mercy on me in this\\nhour, if, in my love for her, so young and good, I slandered Nature in\\nthe breasts of mothers rendered desperate!', 'Pity my presumption,\\nwickedness, and ignorance, and save her.’  He felt his hold relaxing.', 'They were silent still.', '‘Have mercy on her!’ he exclaimed, ‘as one in whom this dreadful crime\\nhas sprung from Love perverted; from the strongest, deepest Love we\\nfallen creatures know!', 'Think what her misery must have been, when such\\nseed bears such fruit!', 'Heaven meant her to be good.', 'There is no loving\\nmother on the earth who might not come to this, if such a life had gone\\nbefore.', 'O, have mercy on my child, who, even at this pass, means mercy\\nto her own, and dies herself, and perils her immortal soul, to save it!’\\n\\nShe was in his arms.', 'He held her now.', 'His strength was like a giant’s.', '‘I see the Spirit of the Chimes among you!’ cried the old man, singling\\nout the child, and speaking in some inspiration, which their looks\\nconveyed to him.', '‘I know that our inheritance is held in store for us by\\nTime.', 'I know there is a sea of Time to rise one day, before which all\\nwho wrong us or oppress us will be swept away like leaves.', 'I see it, on\\nthe flow!', 'I know that we must trust and hope, and neither doubt\\nourselves, nor doubt the good in one another.', 'I have learnt it from the\\ncreature dearest to my heart.', 'I clasp her in my arms again.', 'O Spirits,\\nmerciful and good, I take your lesson to my breast along with her!', 'O\\nSpirits, merciful and good, I am grateful!’\\n\\nHe might have said more; but, the Bells, the old familiar Bells, his own\\ndear, constant, steady friends, the Chimes, began to ring the joy-peals\\nfor a New Year: so lustily, so merrily, so happily, so gaily, that he\\nleapt upon his feet, and broke the spell that bound him.', '* * * * *\\n\\n‘And whatever you do, father,’ said Meg, ‘don’t eat tripe again, without\\nasking some doctor whether it’s likely to agree with you; for how you\\n_have_ been going on, Good gracious!’\\n\\nShe was working with her needle, at the little table by the fire;\\ndressing her simple gown with ribbons for her wedding.', 'So quietly happy,\\nso blooming and youthful, so full of beautiful promise, that he uttered a\\ngreat cry as if it were an Angel in his house; then flew to clasp her in\\nhis arms.', 'But, he caught his feet in the newspaper, which had fallen on the hearth;\\nand somebody came rushing in between them.', '‘No!’ cried the voice of this same somebody; a generous and jolly voice\\nit was!', '‘Not even you.', 'Not even you.', 'The first kiss of Meg in the New\\nYear is mine.', 'Mine!', 'I have been waiting outside the house, this hour,\\nto hear the Bells and claim it.', 'Meg, my precious prize, a happy year!', 'A\\nlife of happy years, my darling wife!’\\n\\nAnd Richard smothered her with kisses.', 'You never in all your life saw anything like Trotty after this.', 'I don’t\\ncare where you have lived or what you have seen; you never in all your\\nlife saw anything at all approaching him!', 'He sat down in his chair and\\nbeat his knees and cried; he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and\\nlaughed; he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and laughed and\\ncried together; he got out of his chair and hugged Meg; he got out of his\\nchair and hugged Richard; he got out of his chair and hugged them both at\\nonce; he kept running up to Meg, and squeezing her fresh face between his\\nhands and kissing it, going from her backwards not to lose sight of it,\\nand running up again like a figure in a magic lantern; and whatever he\\ndid, he was constantly sitting himself down in his chair, and never\\nstopping in it for one single moment; being—that’s the truth—beside\\nhimself with joy.', '‘And to-morrow’s your wedding-day, my pet!’ cried Trotty.', '‘Your real,\\nhappy wedding-day!’\\n\\n‘To-day!’ cried Richard, shaking hands with him.', '‘To-day.', 'The Chimes\\nare ringing in the New Year.', 'Hear them!’\\n\\nThey WERE ringing!', 'Bless their sturdy hearts, they WERE ringing!', 'Great\\nBells as they were; melodious, deep-mouthed, noble Bells; cast in no\\ncommon metal; made by no common founder; when had they ever chimed like\\nthat, before!', '‘But, to-day, my pet,’ said Trotty.', '‘You and Richard had some words\\nto-day.’\\n\\n‘Because he’s such a bad fellow, father,’ said Meg.', '‘An’t you, Richard?', 'Such a headstrong, violent man!', 'He’d have made no more of speaking his\\nmind to that great Alderman, and putting _him_ down I don’t know where,\\nthan he would of—’\\n\\n‘—Kissing Meg,’ suggested Richard.', 'Doing it too!', '‘No.', 'Not a bit more,’ said Meg.', '‘But I wouldn’t let him, father.', 'Where\\nwould have been the use!’\\n\\n‘Richard my boy!’ cried Trotty.', '‘You was turned up Trumps originally;\\nand Trumps you must be, till you die!', 'But, you were crying by the fire\\nto-night, my pet, when I came home!', 'Why did you cry by the fire?’\\n\\n‘I was thinking of the years we’ve passed together, father.', 'Only that.', 'And thinking that you might miss me, and be lonely.’\\n\\nTrotty was backing off to that extraordinary chair again, when the child,\\nwho had been awakened by the noise, came running in half-dressed.', '‘Why, here she is!’ cried Trotty, catching her up.', '‘Here’s little\\nLilian!', 'Ha ha ha!', 'Here we are and here we go!', 'O here we are and here\\nwe go again!', 'And here we are and here we go!', 'and Uncle Will too!’\\nStopping in his trot to greet him heartily.', '‘O, Uncle Will, the vision\\nthat I’ve had to-night, through lodging you!', 'O, Uncle Will, the\\nobligations that you’ve laid me under, by your coming, my good friend!’\\n\\nBefore Will Fern could make the least reply, a band of music burst into\\nthe room, attended by a lot of neighbours, screaming ‘A Happy New Year,\\nMeg!’  ‘A Happy Wedding!’  ‘Many of ’em!’ and other fragmentary good\\nwishes of that sort.', 'The Drum (who was a private friend of Trotty’s)\\nthen stepped forward, and said:\\n\\n‘Trotty Veck, my boy!', 'It’s got about, that your daughter is going to be\\nmarried to-morrow.', 'There an’t a soul that knows you that don’t wish you\\nwell, or that knows her and don’t wish her well.', 'Or that knows you both,\\nand don’t wish you both all the happiness the New Year can bring.', 'And\\nhere we are, to play it in and dance it in, accordingly.’\\n\\nWhich was received with a general shout.', 'The Drum was rather drunk,\\nby-the-bye; but, never mind.', '‘What a happiness it is, I’m sure,’ said Trotty, ‘to be so esteemed!', 'How\\nkind and neighbourly you are!', 'It’s all along of my dear daughter.', 'She\\ndeserves it!’\\n\\nThey were ready for a dance in half a second (Meg and Richard at the\\ntop); and the Drum was on the very brink of feathering away with all his\\npower; when a combination of prodigious sounds was heard outside, and a\\ngood-humoured comely woman of some fifty years of age, or thereabouts,\\ncame running in, attended by a man bearing a stone pitcher of terrific\\nsize, and closely followed by the marrow-bones and cleavers, and the\\nbells; not _the_ Bells, but a portable collection on a frame.', 'Trotty said, ‘It’s Mrs. Chickenstalker!’  And sat down and beat his knees\\nagain.', '‘Married, and not tell me, Meg!’ cried the good woman.', '‘Never!', 'I\\ncouldn’t rest on the last night of the Old Year without coming to wish\\nyou joy.', 'I couldn’t have done it, Meg.', 'Not if I had been bed-ridden.', 'So here I am; and as it’s New Year’s Eve, and the Eve of your wedding\\ntoo, my dear, I had a little flip made, and brought it with me.’\\n\\nMrs. Chickenstalker’s notion of a little flip did honour to her\\ncharacter.', 'The pitcher steamed and smoked and reeked like a volcano; and\\nthe man who had carried it, was faint.', '‘Mrs.', 'Tugby!’ said Trotty, who had been going round and round her, in an\\necstasy.—‘I _should_ say, Chickenstalker—Bless your heart and soul!', 'A\\nHappy New Year, and many of ’em!', 'Mrs. Tugby,’ said Trotty when he had\\nsaluted her;—‘I _should_ say, Chickenstalker—This is William Fern and\\nLilian.’\\n\\nThe worthy dame, to his surprise, turned very pale and very red.', '‘Not Lilian Fern whose mother died in Dorsetshire!’ said she.', 'Her uncle answered ‘Yes,’ and meeting hastily, they exchanged some\\nhurried words together; of which the upshot was, that Mrs. Chickenstalker\\nshook him by both hands; saluted Trotty on his cheek again of her own\\nfree will; and took the child to her capacious breast.', '‘Will Fern!’ said Trotty, pulling on his right-hand muffler.', '‘Not the\\nfriend you was hoping to find?’\\n\\n‘Ay!’ returned Will, putting a hand on each of Trotty’s shoulders.', '‘And\\nlike to prove a’most as good a friend, if that can be, as one I found.’\\n\\n‘O!’ said Trotty.', '‘Please to play up there.', 'Will you have the\\ngoodness!’\\n\\nTo the music of the band, and, the bells, the marrow-bones and cleavers,\\nall at once; and while the Chimes were yet in lusty operation out of\\ndoors; Trotty, making Meg and Richard, second couple, led off Mrs.\\nChickenstalker down the dance, and danced it in a step unknown before or\\nsince; founded on his own peculiar trot.', 'Had Trotty dreamed?', 'Or, are his joys and sorrows, and the actors in\\nthem, but a dream; himself a dream; the teller of this tale a dreamer,\\nwaking but now?', 'If it be so, O listener, dear to him in all his visions,\\ntry to bear in mind the stern realities from which these shadows come;\\nand in your sphere—none is too wide, and none too limited for such

a beautiful day, a\\nretired spot; and the two girls, quite unconstrained and careless, danced\\nin the freedom and gaiety of their hearts.', 'If there were no such thing as display in the world, my private opinion\\nis, and I hope you agree with me, that we might get on a great deal\\nbetter than we do, and might be infinitely more agreeable company than we\\nare.', 'It was charming to see how these girls danced.', 'They had no\\nspectators but the apple-pickers on the ladders.', 'They were very glad to\\nplease them, but they danced to please themselves (or at least you would\\nhave supposed so);

though the truth is, it had\\ngone at such a pace, and worked itself to such a pitch of competition\\nwith the dancing, that it never could have held on, half a minute longer.', 'The apple-pickers on the ladders raised a hum and murmur of applause, and\\nthen, in keeping with the sound, bestirred themselves to work again like\\nbees.', 'The more actively, perhaps, because an elderly gentleman, who was no\\nother than Doctor Jeddler himself—it was Doctor Jeddler’s house and\\norchard, you should know, and these were Doctor Jeddler’s daughters—came\\nbustling out to see what was the matter, and who the deuce played music\\non his property, before breakfast.', 'For he was a great philosopher,\\nDoctor Jeddler, and not very musical.', '‘Music and dancing _to-day_!’ said the Doctor, stopping short, and\\nspeaking to himself.', '‘I thought they dreaded to-day.', 'But it’s a world\\nof contradictions.', 'Why, Grace, why, Marion!’ he added, aloud, ‘is the\\nworld more mad than usual this morning?’\\n\\n‘Make some allowance for it, father, if it be,’ replied his younger\\ndaughter, Marion, going close to him, and looking into his face, ‘for\\nit’s somebody’s birth-day.’\\n\\n‘Somebody’s birth-day, Puss!’ replied the Doctor.', '‘Don’t you know it’s\\nalways somebody’s birth-day?', 'Did you never hear how many new performers\\nenter on this—ha!', 'ha!', 'ha!—it’s impossible to speak gravely of it—on this\\npreposterous and ridiculous business called Life, every minute?’\\n\\n‘No, father!’\\n\\n‘No, not you, of course;

‘and many happy returns of the—the idea!—of the day.', 'The notion of\\nwishing happy returns in such a farce as this,’ said the Doctor to\\nhimself, ‘is good!', 'Ha!', 'ha!', 'ha!’\\n\\nDoctor Jeddler was, as I have said, a great philosopher, and the heart\\nand mystery of his philosophy was, to look upon the world as a gigantic\\npractical joke; as something too absurd to be considered seriously, by\\nany rational man.', 'His system of belief had been, in the beginning, part\\nand parcel of the battle-ground on which he lived, as you shall presently\\nunderstand.', '‘Well!', 'But how did you get the music?’ asked the Doctor.', '‘Poultry-stealers, of course!', 'Where did the minstrels come from?’\\n\\n‘Alfred sent the music,’ said his daughter Grace, adjusting a few simple\\nflowers in her sister’s hair, with which, in her admiration of that\\nyouthful beauty, she had herself adorned it half-an-hour before, and\\nwhich the dancing had disarranged.', '‘Oh!', 'Alfred sent the music, did he?’ returned the Doctor.', '‘Yes.', 'He met it coming out of the town as he was entering early.', 'The\\nmen are travelling on foot, and rested there last night; and as it was\\nMarion’s birth-day, and he thought it would please her, he sent them on,\\nwith a pencilled note to me, saying that if I thought so too, they had\\ncome to serenade her.’\\n\\n‘Ay, ay,’ said the Doctor, carelessly, ‘he always takes your opinion.’\\n\\n‘And my opinion being favourable,’ said Grace, good-humouredly; and\\npausing for a moment to admire the pretty head she decorated, with her\\nown thrown back; ‘and Marion being in high spirits, and beginning to\\ndance, I joined her.', 'And so we danced to Alfred’s music till we were out\\nof breath.', 'And we thought the music all the gayer for being sent by\\nAlfred.', 'Didn’t we, dear Marion?’\\n\\n‘Oh, I don’t know, Grace.', 'How you tease me about Alfred.’\\n\\n‘Tease you by mentioning your lover?’ said her sister.', '‘I am sure I don’t much care to have him mentioned,’ said the wilful\\nbeauty, stripping the petals from some flowers she held, and scattering\\nthem on the ground.', '‘I am almost tired of hearing of him; and as to his\\nbeing my lover—’\\n\\n‘Hush!', 'Don’t speak lightly of a true heart, which is all your own,\\nMarion,’ cried her sister, ‘even in jest.', 'There is not a truer heart\\nthan Alfred’s in the world!’\\n\\n‘No-no,’ said Marion, raising her eyebrows with a pleasant air of\\ncareless consideration, ‘perhaps not.', 'But I don’t know that there’s any\\ngreat merit in that.', 'I—I don’t want him to be so very true.', 'I never\\nasked him.', 'If he expects that I— But, dear Grace, why need we talk of\\nhim at all, just now!’\\n\\nIt was agreeable to see the graceful figures of the blooming sisters,\\ntwined together, lingering among the trees, conversing thus, with\\nearnestness opposed to lightness, yet, with love responding tenderly to\\nlove.', 'And it was very curious indeed to see the younger sister’s eyes\\nsuffused with tears, and something fervently and deeply felt, breaking\\nthrough the wilfulness of what she said, and striving with it painfully.', 'The difference between them, in respect of age, could not exceed four\\nyears at most; but Grace, as often happens in such cases, when no mother\\nwatches over both (the Doctor’s wife was dead), seemed, in her gentle\\ncare of her young sister, and in the steadiness of her devotion to her,\\nolder than she was; and more removed, in course of nature, from all\\ncompetition with her, or participation, otherwise than through her\\nsympathy and true affection, in her wayward fancies, than their ages\\nseemed to warrant.', 'Great character of mother, that, even in this shadow\\nand faint reflection of it, purifies the heart, and raises the exalted\\nnature nearer to the angels!', 'The Doctor’s reflections, as he looked after them, and heard the purport\\nof their discourse, were limited at first to certain merry meditations on\\nthe folly of all loves and likings, and the idle imposition practised on\\nthemselves by young people, who believed for a moment, that there could\\nbe anything serious in such bubbles, and were always undeceived—always!', 'But, the home-adorning, self-denying qualities of Grace, and her sweet\\ntemper, so gentle and retiring, yet including so much constancy and\\nbravery of spirit, seemed all expressed to him in the contrast between\\nher quiet household figure and that of his younger and more beautiful\\nchild; and he was sorry for her sake—sorry for them both—that life should\\nbe such a very ridiculous business as it was.', 'The Doctor never dreamed of inquiring whether his children, or either of\\nthem, helped in any way to make the scheme a serious one.', 'But then he\\nwas a Philosopher.', 'A kind and generous man by nature, he had stumbled, by chance, over that\\ncommon Philosopher’s stone (much more easily discovered than the object\\nof the alchemist’s researches), which sometimes trips up kind and\\ngenerous men, and has the fatal property of turning gold to dross and\\nevery precious thing to poor account.', '‘Britain!’ cried the Doctor.', '‘Britain!', 'Holloa!’\\n\\nA small man, with an uncommonly sour and discontented face, emerged from\\nthe house, and returned to this call the unceremonious acknowledgment of\\n‘Now then!’\\n\\n‘Where’s the breakfast table?’ said the Doctor.', '‘In the house,’ returned Britain.', '‘Are you going to spread it out here, as you were told last night?’ said\\nthe Doctor.', '‘Don’t you know that there are gentlemen coming?', 'That\\nthere’s business to be done this morning, before the coach comes by?', 'That this is a very particular occasion?’\\n\\n‘I couldn’t do anything, Dr. Jeddler, till the women had done getting in\\nthe apples, could I?’ said Britain, his voice rising with his reasoning,\\nso that it was very loud at last.', '‘Well, have they done now?’ replied the Doctor, looking at his watch, and\\nclapping his hands.', '‘Come!', 'make haste!', 'where’s Clemency?’\\n\\n‘Here am I, Mister,’ said a voice from one of the ladders, which a pair\\nof clumsy feet descended briskly.', '‘It’s all done now.', 'Clear away, gals.', 'Everything shall be ready for you in half a minute, Mister.’\\n\\nWith that she began to bustle about most vigorously; presenting, as she\\ndid so, an appearance sufficiently peculiar to justify a word of\\nintroduction.', 'She was about thirty years old, and had a sufficiently plump and cheerful\\nface, though it was twisted up into an odd expression of tightness that\\nmade it comical.', 'But, the extraordinary homeliness of her gait and\\nmanner, would have superseded any face in the world.', 'To say that she had\\ntwo left legs, and somebody else’s arms, and that all four limbs seemed\\nto be out of joint, and to start from perfectly wrong places when they\\nwere set in motion, is to offer the mildest outline of the reality.', 'To\\nsay that she was perfectly content and satisfied with these arrangements,\\nand regarded them as being no business of hers, and that she took her\\narms and legs as they came, and allowed them to dispose of themselves\\njust as it happened, is to render faint justice to her equanimity.', 'Her\\ndress was a prodigious pair of self-willed shoes, that never wanted to go\\nwhere her feet went; blue stockings; a printed gown of many colours, and\\nthe most hideous pattern procurable for money; and a white apron.', 'She\\nalways wore short sleeves, and always had, by some accident, grazed\\nelbows, in which she took so lively an interest, that she was continually\\ntrying to turn them round and get impossible views of them.', 'In general,\\na little cap placed somewhere on her head; though it was rarely to be met\\nwith in the place usually occupied in other subjects, by that article of\\ndress; but, from head to foot she was scrupulously clean, and maintained\\na kind of dislocated tidiness.', 'Indeed, her laudable anxiety to be tidy\\nand compact in her own conscience as well as in the public eye, gave rise\\nto one of her most startling evolutions, which was to grasp herself\\nsometimes by a sort of wooden handle (part of her clothing, and\\nfamiliarly called a busk), and wrestle as it were with her garments,\\nuntil they fell into a symmetrical arrangement.', 'Such, in outward form and garb, was Clemency Newcome; who was supposed to\\nhave unconsciously originated a corruption of her own Christian name,\\nfrom Clementina (but nobody knew, for the deaf old mother, a very\\nphenomenon of age, whom she had supported almost from a child, was dead,\\nand she had no other relation); who now busied herself in preparing the\\ntable, and who stood, at intervals, with her bare red arms crossed,\\nrubbing her grazed elbows with opposite hands, and staring at it very\\ncomposedly, until she suddenly remembered something else she wanted, and\\njogged off to fetch it.', '‘Here are them two lawyers a-coming, Mister!’ said Clemency, in a tone of\\nno very great good-will.', '‘Ah!’ cried the Doctor, advancing to the gate to meet them.', '‘Good\\nmorning, good morning!', 'Grace, my dear!', 'Marion!', 'Here are Messrs.\\nSnitchey and Craggs.', 'Where’s Alfred!’\\n\\n‘He’ll be back directly, father, no doubt,’ said Grace.', '‘He had so much\\nto do this morning in his preparations for departure, that he was up and\\nout by daybreak.', 'Good morning, gentlemen.’\\n\\n‘Ladies!’ said Mr. Snitchey, ‘for Self and Craggs,’ who bowed, ‘good\\nmorning!', 'Miss,’ to Marion, ‘I kiss your hand.’  Which he did.', '‘And I\\nwish you’—which he might or might not, for he didn’t look, at first\\nsight, like a gentleman troubled with many warm outpourings of soul, in\\nbehalf of other people, ‘a hundred happy returns of this auspicious day.’\\n\\n‘Ha ha ha!’ laughed the Doctor thoughtfully, with his hands in his\\npockets.', '‘The great farce in a hundred acts!’\\n\\n‘You wouldn’t, I am sure,’ said Mr. Snitchey, standing a small\\nprofessional blue bag against one leg of the table, ‘cut the great farce\\nshort for this actress, at all events, Doctor Jeddler.’\\n\\n‘No,’ returned the Doctor.', '‘God forbid!', 'May she live to laugh at it, as\\nlong as she _can_ laugh, and then say, with the French wit, “The farce is\\nended; draw the curtain.”’\\n\\n‘The French wit,’ said Mr. Snitchey, peeping sharply into his blue bag,\\n‘was wrong, Doctor Jeddler, and your philosophy is altogether wrong,\\ndepend upon it, as I have often told you.', 'Nothing serious in life!', 'What\\ndo you call law?’\\n\\n‘A joke,’ replied the Doctor.', '‘Did you ever go to law?’ asked Mr. Snitchey, looking out of the blue\\nbag.', '‘Never,’ returned the Doctor.', '‘If you ever do,’ said Mr. Snitchey, ‘perhaps you’ll alter that opinion.’\\n\\nCraggs, who seemed to be represented by Snitchey, and to be conscious of\\nlittle or no separate existence or personal individuality, offered a\\nremark of his own in this place.', 'It involved the only idea of which he\\ndid not stand seized and possessed in equal moieties with Snitchey;

adding, as he put the tumbler down\\nagain:\\n\\n‘It’s a new house, is it not?’\\n\\n‘Not particularly new, sir,’ replied Mr. Britain.', '‘Between five and six years old,’ said Clemency; speaking very\\ndistinctly.', '‘I think I heard you mention Dr. Jeddler’s name, as I came in,’ inquired\\nthe stranger.', '‘That bill reminds me of him; for I happen to know\\nsomething of that story, by hearsay, and through certain connexions of\\nmine.—Is the old man living?’\\n\\n‘Yes, he’s living, sir,’ said Clemency.', '‘Much changed?’\\n\\n‘Since when, sir?’ returned Clemency, with remarkable emphasis and\\nexpression.', '‘Since his daughter—went away.’\\n\\n‘Yes!', 'he’s greatly changed since then,’ said Clemency.', '‘He’s grey and\\nold, and hasn’t the same way with him at all; but, I think he’s happy\\nnow.', 'He has taken on with his sister since then, and goes to see her\\nvery often.', 'That did him good, directly.', 'At first, he was sadly broken\\ndown; and it was enough to make one’s heart bleed, to see him wandering\\nabout, railing at the world; but a great change for the better came over\\nhim after a year or two, and then he began to like to talk about his lost\\ndaughter, and to praise her, ay and the world too!', 'and was never tired of\\nsaying, with the tears in his poor eyes, how beautiful and good she was.', 'He had forgiven her then.', 'That was about the same time as Miss Grace’s\\nmarriage.', 'Britain, you remember?’\\n\\nMr. Britain remembered very well.', '‘The sister is married then,’ returned the stranger.', 'He paused for some\\ntime before he asked, ‘To whom?’\\n\\nClemency narrowly escaped oversetting the tea-board, in her emotion at\\nthis question.', '‘Did _you_ never hear?’ she said.', '‘I should like to hear,’ he replied, as he filled his glass again, and\\nraised it to his lips.', '‘Ah!', 'It would be a long story, if it was properly told,’ said Clemency,\\nresting her chin on the palm of her left hand, and supporting that elbow\\non her right hand, as she shook her head, and looked back through the\\nintervening years, as if she were looking at a fire.', '‘It would be a long\\nstory, I am sure.’\\n\\n‘But told as a short one,’ suggested the stranger.', 'Told as a short one,’ repeated Clemency in the same thoughtful tone, and\\nwithout any apparent reference to him, or consciousness of having\\nauditors, ‘what would there be to tell?', 'That they grieved together, and\\nremembered her together, like a person dead; that they were so tender of\\nher, never would reproach her, called her back to one another as she used\\nto be, and found excuses for her!', 'Every one knows that.', 'I’m sure I do.', 'No one better,’ added Clemency, wiping her eyes with her hand.', '‘And so,’ suggested the stranger.', '‘And so,’ said Clemency, taking him up mechanically, and without any\\nchange in her attitude or manner, ‘they at last were married.', 'They were\\nmarried on her birth-day—it comes round again to-morrow—very quiet, very\\nhumble like, but very happy.', 'Mr. Alfred said, one night when they were\\nwalking in the orchard, “Grace, shall our wedding-day be Marion’s\\nbirth-day?”  And it was.’\\n\\n‘And they have lived happily together?’ said the stranger.', '‘Ay,’ said Clemency.', '‘No two people ever more so.', 'They have had no\\nsorrow but this.’\\n\\nShe raised her head as with a sudden attention to the circumstances under\\nwhich she was recalling these events, and looked quickly at the stranger.', 'Seeing that his face was turned toward the window, and that he seemed\\nintent upon the prospect, she made some eager signs to her husband, and\\npointed to the bill, and moved her mouth as if she were repeating with\\ngreat energy, one word or phrase to him over and over again.', 'As she\\nuttered no sound, and as her dumb motions like most of her gestures were\\nof a very extraordinary kind, this unintelligible conduct reduced Mr.\\nBritain to the confines of despair.', 'He stared at the table, at the\\nstranger, at the spoons, at his wife—followed her pantomime with looks of\\ndeep amazement and perplexity—asked in the same language, was it property\\nin danger, was it he in danger, was it she—answered her signals with\\nother signals expressive of the deepest distress and confusion—followed\\nthe motions of her lips—guessed half aloud ‘milk and water,’ ‘monthly\\nwarning,’ ‘mice and walnuts’—and couldn’t approach her meaning.', 'Clemency gave it up at last, as a hopeless attempt; and moving her chair\\nby very slow degrees a little nearer to the stranger, sat with her eyes\\napparently cast down but glancing sharply at him now and then, waiting\\nuntil he should ask some other question.', 'She had not to wait long; for\\nhe said, presently:\\n\\n‘And what is the after history of the young lady who went away?', 'They\\nknow it, I suppose?’\\n\\nClemency shook her head.', '‘I’ve heard,’ she said, ‘that Doctor Jeddler is\\nthought to know more of it than he tells.', 'Miss Grace has had letters\\nfrom her sister, saying that she was well and happy, and made much\\nhappier by her being married to Mr. Alfred: and has written letters back.', 'But there’s a mystery about her life and fortunes, altogether, which\\nnothing has cleared up to this hour, and which—’\\n\\nShe faltered here, and stopped.', '‘And which’—repeated the stranger.', '‘Which only one other person, I believe, could explain,’ said Clemency,\\ndrawing her breath quickly.', '‘Who may that be?’ asked the stranger.', '‘Mr.', 'Michael Warden!’ answered Clemency, almost in a shriek: at once\\nconveying to her husband what she would have had him understand before,\\nand letting Michael Warden know that he was recognised.', '‘You remember me, sir?’ said Clemency, trembling with emotion; ‘I saw\\njust now you did!', 'You remember me, that night in the garden.', 'I was with\\nher!’\\n\\n‘Yes.', 'You were,’ he said.', '‘Yes, sir,’ returned Clemency.', '‘Yes, to be sure.', 'This is my husband, if\\nyou please.', 'Ben, my dear Ben, run to Miss Grace—run to Mr. Alfred—run\\nsomewhere, Ben!', 'Bring somebody here, directly!’\\n\\n‘Stay!’ said Michael Warden, quietly interposing himself between the door\\nand Britain.', '‘What would you do?’\\n\\n‘Let them know that you are here, sir,’ answered Clemency, clapping her\\nhands in sheer agitation.', '‘Let them know that they may hear of her, from\\nyour own lips; let them know that she is not quite lost to them, but that\\nshe will come home again yet, to bless her father and her loving\\nsister—even her old servant, even me,’ she struck herself upon the breast\\nwith both hands, ‘with a sight of her sweet face.', 'Run, Ben, run!’  And\\nstill she pressed him on towards the door, and still Mr.', 'Warden stood\\nbefore it, with his hand stretched out, not angrily, but sorrowfully.', '‘Or perhaps,’ said Clemency, running past her husband, and catching in\\nher emotion at Mr. Warden’s cloak, ‘perhaps she’s here now; perhaps she’s\\nclose by.', 'I think from your manner she is.', 'Let me see her, sir, if you\\nplease.', 'I waited on her when she was a little child.', 'I saw her grow to\\nbe the pride of all this place.', 'I knew her when she was Mr. Alfred’s\\npromised wife.', 'I tried to warn her when you tempted her away.', 'I know\\nwhat her old home was when she was like the soul of it, and how it\\nchanged when she was gone and lost.', 'Let me speak to her, if you please!’\\n\\nHe gazed at her with compassion, not unmixed with wonder: but, he made no\\ngesture of assent.', '‘I don’t think she _can_ know,’ pursued Clemency, ‘how truly they forgive\\nher; how they love her; what joy it would be to them, to see her once\\nmore.', 'She may be timorous of going home.', 'Perhaps if she sees me, it may\\ngive her new heart.', 'Only tell me truly, Mr.', 'Warden, is she with you?’\\n\\n‘She is not,’ he answered, shaking his head.', 'This answer, and his manner, and his black dress, and his coming back so\\nquietly, and his announced intention of continuing to live abroad,\\nexplained it all.', 'Marion was dead.', 'He didn’t contradict her; yes, she was dead!', 'Clemency sat down, hid her\\nface upon the table, and cried.', 'At that moment, a grey-headed old gentleman came running in: quite out of\\nbreath, and panting so much that his voice was scarcely to be recognised\\nas the voice of Mr. Snitchey.', '‘Good Heaven, Mr.', 'Warden!’ said the lawyer, taking him aside, ‘what wind\\nhas blown—’  He was so blown himself, that he couldn’t get on any further\\nuntil after a pause, when he added, feebly, ‘you here?’\\n\\n‘An ill-wind, I am afraid,’ he answered.', '‘If you could have heard what\\nhas just passed—how I have been besought and entreated to perform\\nimpossibilities—what confusion and affliction I carry with me!’\\n\\n‘I can guess it all.', 'But why did you ever come here, my good sir?’\\nretorted Snitchey.', '‘Come!', 'How should I know who kept the house?', 'When I sent my servant on\\nto you, I strolled in here because the place was new to me; and I had a\\nnatural curiosity in everything new and old, in these old scenes; and it\\nwas outside the town.', 'I wanted to communicate with you, first, before\\nappearing there.', 'I wanted to know what people would say to me.', 'I see by\\nyour manner that you can tell me.', 'If it were not for your confounded\\ncaution, I should have been possessed of everything long ago.’\\n\\n‘Our caution!’ returned the lawyer, ‘speaking for Self and\\nCraggs—deceased,’ here Mr. Snitchey, glancing at his hat-band, shook his\\nhead, ‘how can you reasonably blame us, Mr.', 'Warden?', 'It was understood\\nbetween us that the subject was never to be renewed, and that it wasn’t a\\nsubject on which grave and sober men like us (I made a note of your\\nobservations at the time) could interfere.', 'Our caution too!', 'When Mr.\\nCraggs, sir, went down to his respected grave in the full belief—’\\n\\n‘I had given a solemn promise of silence until I should return, whenever\\nthat might be,’ interrupted Mr.', 'Warden; ‘and I have kept it.’\\n\\n‘Well, sir, and I repeat it,’ returned Mr. Snitchey, ‘we were bound to\\nsilence too.', 'We were bound to silence in our duty towards ourselves, and\\nin our duty towards a variety of clients, you among them, who were as\\nclose as wax.', 'It was not our place to make inquiries of you on such a\\ndelicate subject.', 'I had my suspicions, sir; but, it is not six months\\nsince I have known the truth, and been assured that you lost her.’\\n\\n‘By whom?’ inquired his client.', '‘By Doctor Jeddler himself, sir, who at last reposed that confidence in\\nme voluntarily.', 'He, and only he, has known the whole truth, years and\\nyears.’\\n\\n‘And you know it?’ said his client.', '‘I do, sir!’ replied Snitchey; ‘and I have also reason to know that it\\nwill be broken to her sister to-morrow evening.', 'They have given her that\\npromise.', 'In the meantime, perhaps you’ll give me the honour of your\\ncompany at my house; being unexpected at your own.', 'But, not to run the\\nchance of any more such difficulties as you have had here, in case you\\nshould be recognised—though you’re a good deal changed; I think I might\\nhave passed you myself, Mr. Warden—we had better dine here, and walk on\\nin the evening.', 'It’s a very good place to dine at, Mr.', 'Warden: your own\\nproperty, by-the-bye.', 'Self and Craggs (deceased) took a chop here\\nsometimes, and had it very comfortably served.', 'Mr. Craggs, sir,’ said\\nSnitchey, shutting his eyes tight for an instant, and opening them again,\\n‘was struck off the roll of life too soon.’\\n\\n‘Heaven forgive me for not condoling with you,’ returned Michael Warden,\\npassing his hand across his forehead, ‘but I’m like a man in a dream at\\npresent.', 'I seem to want my wits.', 'Mr. Craggs—yes—I am very sorry we have\\nlost Mr. Craggs.’  But he looked at Clemency as he said it, and seemed to\\nsympathise with Ben, consoling her.', '‘Mr.', 'Craggs, sir,’ observed Snitchey, ‘didn’t find life, I regret to say,\\nas easy to have and to hold as his theory made it out, or he would have\\nbeen among us now.', 'It’s a great loss to me.', 'He was my right arm, my\\nright leg, my right ear, my right eye, was Mr. Craggs.', 'I am paralytic\\nwithout him.', 'He bequeathed his share of the business to Mrs. Craggs, her\\nexecutors, administrators, and assigns.', 'His name remains in the Firm to\\nthis hour.', 'I try, in a childish sort of a way, to make believe,\\nsometimes, he’s alive.', 'You may observe that I speak for Self and\\nCraggs—deceased, sir—deceased,’ said the tender-hearted attorney, waving\\nhis pocket-handkerchief.', 'Michael Warden, who had still been observant of Clemency, turned to Mr.\\nSnitchey when he ceased to speak, and whispered in his ear.', '‘Ah, poor thing!’ said Snitchey, shaking his head.', '‘Yes.', 'She was always\\nvery faithful to Marion.', 'She was always very fond of her.', 'Pretty\\nMarion!', 'Poor Marion!', 'Cheer up, Mistress—you are married now, you know,\\nClemency.’\\n\\nClemency only sighed, and shook her head.', '‘Well, well!', 'Wait till to-morrow,’ said the lawyer, kindly.', '‘To-morrow can’t bring back’ the dead to life, Mister,’ said Clemency,\\nsobbing.', '‘No.', 'It can’t do that, or it would bring back Mr. Craggs, deceased,’\\nreturned the lawyer.', '‘But it may bring some soothing circumstances; it\\nmay bring some comfort.', 'Wait till to-morrow!’\\n\\nSo Clemency, shaking his proffered hand, said she would; and Britain, who\\nhad been terribly cast down at sight of his despondent wife (which was\\nlike the business hanging its head), said that was right; and Mr.\\nSnitchey and Michael Warden went up-stairs; and there they were soon\\nengaged in a conversation so cautiously conducted, that no murmur of it\\nwas audible above the clatter of plates and dishes, the hissing of the\\nfrying-pan, the bubbling of saucepans, the low monotonous waltzing of the\\njack—with a dreadful click every now and then as if it had met with some\\nmortal accident to its head, in a fit of giddiness—and all the other\\npreparations in the kitchen for their dinner.', '* * * * *\\n\\nTo-morrow was a bright and peaceful day; and nowhere were the autumn\\ntints more beautifully seen, than from the quiet orchard of the Doctor’s\\nhouse.', 'The snows of many winter nights had melted from that ground, the\\nwithered leaves of many summer times had rustled there, since she had\\nfled.', 'The honey-suckle porch was green again, the trees cast bountiful\\nand changing shadows on the grass, the landscape was as tranquil and\\nserene as it had ever been; but where was she!', 'Not there.', 'Not there.', 'She would have been a stranger sight in her old\\nhome now, even than that home had been at first, without her.', 'But, a\\nlady sat in the familiar place, from whose heart she had never passed\\naway; in whose true memory she lived, unchanging, youthful, radiant with\\nall promise and all hope; in whose affection—and it was a mother’s now,\\nthere was a cherished little daughter playing by her side—she had no\\nrival, no successor; upon whose gentle lips her name was trembling then.', 'The spirit of the lost girl looked out of those eyes.', 'Those eyes of\\nGrace, her sister, sitting with her husband in the orchard, on their\\nwedding-day, and his and Marion’s birth-day.', 'He had not become a great man; he had not grown rich; he had not\\nforgotten the scenes and friends of his youth; he had not fulfilled any\\none of the Doctor’s old predictions.', 'But, in his useful, patient,\\nunknown visiting of poor men’s homes; and in his watching of sick beds;\\nand in his daily knowledge of the gentleness and goodness flowering the\\nby-paths of this world, not to be trodden down beneath the heavy foot of\\npoverty, but springing up, elastic, in its track, and making its way\\nbeautiful; he had better learned and proved, in each succeeding year, the\\ntruth of his old faith.', 'The manner of his life, though quiet and remote,\\nhad shown him how often men still entertained angels, unawares, as in the\\nolden time; and how the most unlikely forms—even some that were mean and\\nugly to the view, and poorly clad—became irradiated by the couch of\\nsorrow, want, and pain, and changed to ministering spirits with a glory\\nround their heads.', 'He lived to better purpose on the altered battle-ground, perhaps, than if\\nhe had contended restlessly in more ambitious lists; and he was happy\\nwith his wife, dear Grace.', 'And Marion.', 'Had _he_ forgotten her?', '‘The time has flown, dear Grace,’ he said, ‘since then;’ they had been\\ntalking of that night; ‘and yet it seems a long long while ago.', 'We count\\nby changes and events within us.', 'Not by years.’\\n\\n‘Yet we have years to count by, too, since Marion was with us,’ returned\\nGrace.', '‘Six times, dear husband, counting to-night as one, we have sat\\nhere on her birth-day, and spoken together of that happy return, so\\neagerly expected and so long deferred.', 'Ah when will it be!', 'When will it\\nbe!’\\n\\nHer husband attentively observed her, as the tears collected in her eyes;\\nand drawing nearer, said:\\n\\n‘But, Marion told you, in that farewell letter which she left for you\\nupon your table, love, and which you read so often, that years must pass\\naway before it _could_ be.', 'Did she not?’\\n\\nShe took a letter from her breast, and kissed it, and said ‘Yes.’\\n\\n‘That through these intervening years, however happy she might be, she\\nwould look forward to the time when you would meet again, and all would\\nbe made clear; and that she prayed you, trustfully and hopefully to do\\nthe same.', 'The letter runs so, does it not, my dear?’\\n\\n‘Yes, Alfred.’\\n\\n‘And every other letter she has written since?’\\n\\n‘Except the last—some months ago—in which she spoke of you, and what you\\nthen knew, and what I was to learn to-night.’\\n\\nHe looked towards the sun, then fast declining, and said that the\\nappointed time was sunset.', '‘Alfred!’ said Grace, laying her hand upon his shoulder earnestly, ‘there\\nis something in this letter—this old letter, which you say I read so\\noften—that I have never told you.', 'But, to-night, dear husband, with that\\nsunset drawing near, and all our life seeming to soften and become hushed\\nwith the departing day, I cannot keep it secret.’\\n\\n‘What is it, love?’\\n\\n‘When Marion went away, she wrote me, here, that you had once left her a\\nsacred trust to me, and that now she left you, Alfred, such a trust in my\\nhands: praying and beseeching me, as I loved her, and as I loved you, not\\nto reject the affection she believed (she knew, she said) you would\\ntransfer to me when the new wound was healed, but to encourage and return\\nit.’\\n\\n‘—And make me a proud, and happy man again, Grace.', 'Did she say so?’\\n\\n‘She meant, to make myself so blest and honoured in your love,’ was his\\nwife’s answer, as he held her in his arms.', '‘Hear me, my dear!’ he said.—‘No.', 'Hear me so!’—and as he spoke, he\\ngently laid the head she had raised, again upon his shoulder.', '‘I know\\nwhy I have never heard this passage in the letter, until now.', 'I know why\\nno trace of it ever showed itself in any word or look of yours at that\\ntime.', 'I know why Grace, although so true a friend to me, was hard to win\\nto be my wife.', 'And knowing it, my own!', 'I know the priceless value of the\\nheart I gird within my arms, and thank GOD for the rich possession!’\\n\\nShe wept, but not for sorrow, as he pressed her to his heart.', 'After a\\nbrief space, he looked down at the child, who was sitting at their feet\\nplaying with a little basket of flowers, and bade her look how golden and\\nhow red the sun was.', '‘Alfred,’ said Grace, raising her head quickly at these words.', '‘The sun\\nis going down.', 'You have not forgotten what I am to know before it sets.’\\n\\n‘You are to know the truth of Marion’s history, my love,’ he answered.', '‘All the truth,’ she said, imploringly.', '‘Nothing veiled from me, any\\nmore.', 'That was the promise.', 'Was it not?’\\n\\n‘It was,’ he answered.', '‘Before the sun went down on Marion’s birth-day.', 'And you see it, Alfred?', 'It is sinking fast.’\\n\\nHe put his arm about her waist, and, looking steadily into her eyes,\\nrejoined:\\n\\n‘That truth is not reserved so long for me to tell, dear Grace.', 'It is to\\ncome from other lips.’\\n\\n‘From other lips!’ she faintly echoed.', '‘Yes.', 'I know your constant heart, I know how brave you are, I know that\\nto you a word of preparation is enough.', 'You have said, truly, that the\\ntime is come.', 'It is.', 'Tell me that you have present fortitude to bear a\\ntrial—a surprise—a shock: and the messenger is waiting at the gate.’\\n\\n‘What messenger?’ she said.', '‘And what intelligence does he bring?’\\n\\n‘I am pledged,’ he answered her, preserving his steady look, ‘to say no\\nmore.', 'Do you think you understand me?’\\n\\n‘I am afraid to think,’ she said.', 'There was that emotion in his face, despite its steady gaze, which\\nfrightened her.', 'Again she hid her own face on his shoulder, trembling,\\nand entreated him to pause—a moment.', '‘Courage, my wife!', 'When you have firmness to receive the messenger, the\\nmessenger is waiting at the gate.', 'The sun is setting on Marion’s\\nbirth-day.', 'Courage, courage, Grace!’\\n\\nShe raised her head, and, looking at him, told him she was ready.', 'As she\\nstood, and looked upon him going away, her face was so like Marion’s as\\nit had been in her later days at home, that it was wonderful to see.', 'He\\ntook the child with him.', 'She called her back—she bore the lost girl’s\\nname—and pressed her to her bosom.', 'The little creature, being released\\nagain, sped after him, and Grace was left alone.', 'She knew not what she dreaded, or what hoped; but remained there,\\nmotionless, looking at the porch by which they had disappeared.', 'Ah!', 'what was that, emerging from its shadow; standing on its threshold!', 'That figure, with its white garments rustling in the evening air; its\\nhead laid down upon her father’s breast, and pressed against it to his\\nloving heart!', 'O God!', 'was it a vision that came bursting from the old\\nman’s arms, and with a cry, and with a waving of its hands, and with a\\nwild precipitation of itself upon her in its boundless love, sank down in\\nher embrace!', '‘Oh, Marion, Marion!', 'Oh, my sister!', 'Oh, my heart’s dear love!', 'Oh, joy\\nand happiness unutterable, so to meet again!’\\n\\nIt was no dream, no phantom conjured up by hope and fear, but Marion,\\nsweet Marion!', 'So beautiful, so happy, so unalloyed by care and trial, so\\nelevated and exalted in her loveliness, that as the setting sun shone\\nbrightly on her upturned face, she might have been a spirit visiting the\\nearth upon some healing mission.', 'Clinging to her sister, who had dropped upon a seat and bent down over\\nher—and smiling through her tears—and kneeling, close before her, with\\nboth arms twining round her, and never turning for an instant from her\\nface—and with the glory of the setting sun upon her brow, and with the\\nsoft tranquillity of evening gathering around them—Marion at length broke\\nsilence; her voice, so calm, low, clear, and pleasant, well-tuned to the\\ntime.', '‘When this was my dear home, Grace, as it will be now again—’\\n\\n‘Stay, my sweet love!', 'A moment!', 'O Marion, to hear you speak again.’\\n\\nShe could not bear the voice she loved so well, at first.', '‘When this was my dear home, Grace, as it will be now again, I loved him\\nfrom my soul.', 'I loved him most devotedly.', 'I would have died for him,\\nthough I was so young.', 'I never slighted his affection in my secret\\nbreast for one brief instant.', 'It was far beyond all price to me.', 'Although it is so long ago, and past, and gone, and everything is wholly\\nchanged, I could not bear to think that you, who love so well, should\\nthink I did not truly love him once.', 'I never loved him better, Grace,\\nthan when he left this very scene upon this very day.', 'I never loved him\\nbetter, dear one, than I did that night when I left here.’\\n\\nHer sister, bending over her, could look into her face, and hold her\\nfast.', '‘But he had gained, unconsciously,’ said Marion, with a gentle smile,\\n‘another heart, before I knew that I had one to give him.', 'That\\nheart—yours, my sister!—was so yielded up, in all its other tenderness,\\nto me; was so devoted, and so noble; that it plucked its love away, and\\nkept its secret from all eyes but mine—Ah!', 'what other eyes were quickened\\nby such tenderness and gratitude!—and was content to sacrifice itself to\\nme.', 'But, I knew something of its depths.', 'I knew the struggle it had\\nmade.', 'I knew its high, inestimable worth to him, and his appreciation of\\nit, let him love me as he would.', 'I knew the debt I owed it.', 'I had its\\ngreat example every day before me.', 'What you had done for me, I knew that\\nI could do, Grace, if I would, for you.', 'I never laid my head down on my\\npillow, but I prayed with tears to do it.', 'I never laid my head down on\\nmy pillow, but I thought of Alfred’s own words on the day of his\\ndeparture, and how truly he had said (for I knew that, knowing you) that\\nthere were victories gained every day, in struggling hearts, to which\\nthese fields of battle were nothing.', 'Thinking more and more upon the\\ngreat endurance cheerfully sustained, and never known or cared for, that\\nthere must be, every day and hour, in that great strife of which he\\nspoke, my trial seemed to grow light and easy.', 'And He who knows our\\nhearts, my dearest, at this moment, and who knows there is no drop of\\nbitterness or grief—of anything but unmixed happiness—in mine, enabled me\\nto make the resolution that I never would be Alfred’s wife.', 'That he\\nshould be my brother, and your husband, if the course I took could bring\\nthat happy end to pass; but that I never would (Grace, I then loved him\\ndearly, dearly!)', 'be his wife!’\\n\\n‘O Marion!', 'O Marion!’\\n\\n‘I had tried to seem indifferent to him;’ and she pressed her sister’s\\nface against her own; ‘but that was hard, and you were always his true\\nadvocate.', 'I had tried to tell you of my resolution, but you would never\\nhear me; you would never understand me.', 'The time was drawing near for\\nhis return.', 'I felt that I must act, before the daily intercourse between\\nus was renewed.', 'I knew that one great pang, undergone at that time,\\nwould save a lengthened agony to all of us.', 'I knew that if I went away\\nthen, that end must follow which _has_ followed, and which has made us\\nboth so happy, Grace!', 'I wrote to good Aunt Martha, for a refuge in her\\nhouse: I did not then tell her all, but something of my story, and she\\nfreely promised it.', 'While I was contesting that step with myself, and\\nwith my love of you, and home, Mr.', 'Warden, brought here by an accident,\\nbecame, for some time, our companion.’\\n\\n‘I have sometimes feared of late years, that this might have been,’\\nexclaimed her sister; and her countenance was ashy-pale.', '‘You never\\nloved him—and you married him in your self-sacrifice to me!’\\n\\n‘He was then,’ said Marion, drawing her sister closer to her, ‘on the eve\\nof going secretly away for a long time.', 'He wrote to me, after leaving\\nhere; told me what his condition and prospects really were; and offered\\nme his hand.', 'He told me he had seen I was not happy in the prospect of\\nAlfred’s return.', 'I believe he thought my heart had no part in that\\ncontract; perhaps thought I might have loved him once, and did not then;\\nperhaps thought that when I tried to seem indifferent, I tried to hide\\nindifference—I cannot tell.', 'But I wished that you should feel me wholly\\nlost to Alfred—hopeless to him—dead.', 'Do you understand me, love?’\\n\\nHer sister looked into her face, attentively.', 'She seemed in doubt.', '‘I saw Mr.', 'Warden, and confided in his honour; charged him with my\\nsecret, on the eve of his and my departure.', 'He kept it.', 'Do you\\nunderstand me, dear?’\\n\\nGrace looked confusedly upon her.', 'She scarcely seemed to hear.', '‘My love, my sister!’ said Marion, ‘recall your thoughts a moment; listen\\nto me.', 'Do not look so strangely on me.', 'There are countries, dearest,\\nwhere those who would abjure a misplaced passion, or would strive,\\nagainst some cherished feeling of their hearts and conquer it, retire\\ninto a hopeless solitude, and close the world against themselves and\\nworldly loves and hopes for ever.', 'When women do so, they assume that\\nname which is so dear to you and me, and call each other Sisters.', 'But,\\nthere may be sisters, Grace, who, in the broad world out of doors, and\\nunderneath its free sky, and in its crowded places, and among its busy\\nlife, and trying to assist and cheer it and to do some good,—learn the\\nsame lesson; and who, with hearts still fresh and young, and open to all\\nhappiness and means of happiness, can say the battle is long past, the\\nvictory long won.', 'And such a one am I!', 'You understand me now?’\\n\\nStill she looked fixedly upon her, and made no reply.', '‘Oh Grace, dear Grace,’ said Marion, clinging yet more tenderly and\\nfondly to that breast from which she had been so long exiled, ‘if you\\nwere not a happy wife and mother—if I had no little namesake here—if\\nAlfred, my kind brother, were not your own fond husband—from whence could\\nI derive the ecstasy I feel to-night!', 'But, as I left here, so I have\\nreturned.', 'My heart has known no other love, my hand has never been\\nbestowed apart from it.', 'I am still your maiden sister, unmarried,\\nunbetrothed: your own loving old Marion, in whose affection you exist\\nalone and have no partner, Grace!’\\n\\nShe understood her now.', 'Her face relaxed: sobs came to her relief; and\\nfalling on her neck, she wept and wept, and fondled her as if she were a\\nchild again.', 'When they were more composed, they found that the Doctor, and his sister\\ngood Aunt Martha, were standing near at hand, with Alfred.', '‘This is a weary day for me,’ said good Aunt Martha, smiling through her\\ntears, as she embraced her nieces; ‘for I lose my dear companion in\\nmaking you all happy; and what can you give me, in return for my Marion?’\\n\\n‘A converted brother,’ said the Doctor.', '‘That’s something, to be sure,’ retorted Aunt Martha, ‘in such a farce\\nas—’\\n\\n‘No, pray don’t,’ said the doctor penitently.', '‘Well, I won’t,’ replied Aunt Martha.', '‘But, I consider myself ill used.', 'I don’t know what’s to become of me without my Marion, after we have\\nlived together half-a-dozen years.’\\n\\n‘You must come and live here, I suppose,’ replied the Doctor.', '‘We shan’t\\nquarrel now, Martha.’\\n\\n‘Or you must get married, Aunt,’ said Alfred.', '‘Indeed,’ returned the old lady, ‘I think it might be a good speculation\\nif I were to set my cap at Michael Warden, who, I hear, is come home much\\nthe better for his absence in all respects.', 'But as I knew him when he\\nwas a boy, and I was not a very young woman then, perhaps he mightn’t\\nrespond.', 'So I’ll make up my mind to go and live with Marion, when she\\nmarries, and until then (it will not be very long, I dare say) to live\\nalone.', 'What do _you_ say, Brother?’\\n\\n‘I’ve a great mind to say it’s a ridiculous world altogether, and there’s\\nnothing serious in it,’ observed the poor old Doctor.', '‘You might take twenty affidavits of it if you chose, Anthony,’ said his\\nsister; ‘but nobody would believe you with such eyes as those.’\\n\\n‘It’s a world full of hearts,’ said the Doctor, hugging his youngest\\ndaughter, and bending across her to hug Grace—for he couldn’t separate\\nthe sisters; ‘and a serious world, with all its folly—even with mine,\\nwhich was enough to have swamped the whole globe; and it is a world on\\nwhich the sun never rises, but it looks upon a thousand bloodless battles\\nthat are some set-off against the miseries and wickedness of\\nBattle-Fields; and it is a world we need be careful how we libel, Heaven\\nforgive us, for it is a world of sacred mysteries, and its Creator only\\nknows what lies beneath the surface of His lightest image!’\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nYou would not be the better pleased with my rude pen, if it dissected and\\nlaid open to your view the transports of this family, long severed and\\nnow reunited.', 'Therefore, I will not follow the poor Doctor through his\\nhumbled recollection of the sorrow he had had, when Marion was lost to\\nhim; nor, will I tell how serious he had found that world to be, in which\\nsome love, deep-anchored, is the portion of all human creatures; nor, how\\nsuch a trifle as the absence of one little unit in the great absurd\\naccount, had stricken him to the ground.', 'Nor, how, in compassion for his\\ndistress, his sister had, long ago, revealed the truth to him by slow\\ndegrees, and brought him to the knowledge of the heart of his\\nself-banished daughter, and to that daughter’s side.', 'Nor, how Alfred Heathfield had been told the truth, too, in the course of\\nthat then current year; and Marion had seen him, and had promised him, as\\nher brother, that on her birth-day, in the evening, Grace should know it\\nfrom her lips at last.', '‘I beg your pardon, Doctor,’ said Mr. Snitchey, looking into the orchard,\\n‘but have I liberty to come in?’\\n\\nWithout waiting for permission, he came straight to Marion, and kissed\\nher hand, quite joyfully.', '‘If Mr. Craggs had been alive, my dear Miss Marion,’ said Mr. Snitchey,\\n‘he would have had great interest in this occasion.', 'It might have\\nsuggested to him, Mr. Alfred, that our life is not too easy perhaps:\\nthat, taken altogether, it will bear any little smoothing we can give it;\\nbut Mr. Craggs was a man who could endure to be convinced, sir.', 'He was\\nalways open to conviction.', 'If he were open to conviction, now, I—this is\\nweakness.', 'Mrs. Snitchey, my dear,’—at his summons that lady appeared\\nfrom behind the door, ‘you are among old friends.’\\n\\nMrs. Snitchey having delivered her congratulations, took her husband\\naside.', '‘One moment, Mr. Snitchey,’ said that lady.', '‘It is not in my nature to\\nrake up the ashes of the departed.’\\n\\n‘No, my dear,’ returned her husband.', '‘Mr.', 'Craggs is—’\\n\\n‘Yes, my dear, he is deceased,’ said Snitchey.', '‘But I ask you if you recollect,’ pursued his wife, ‘that evening of the\\nball?', 'I only ask you that.', 'If you do; and if your memory has not\\nentirely failed you, Mr. Snitchey; and if you are not absolutely in your\\ndotage; I ask you to connect this time with that—to remember how I begged\\nand prayed you, on my knees—’\\n\\n‘Upon your knees, my dear?’ said Mr. Snitchey.', '‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Snitchey, confidently, ‘and you know it—to beware of\\nthat man—to observe his eye—and now to tell me whether I was right, and\\nwhether at that moment he knew secrets which he didn’t choose to tell.’\\n\\n‘Mrs.', 'Snitchey,’ returned her husband, in her ear, ‘Madam.', 'Did you ever\\nobserve anything in _my_ eye?’\\n\\n‘No,’ said Mrs. Snitchey, sharply.', '‘Don’t flatter yourself.’\\n\\n‘Because, Madam, that night,’ he continued, twitching her by the sleeve,\\n‘it happens that we both knew secrets which we didn’t choose to tell, and\\nboth knew just the same professionally.', 'And so the less you say about\\nsuch things the better, Mrs. Snitchey; and take this as a warning to have\\nwiser and more charitable eyes another time.', 'Miss Marion, I brought a\\nfriend of yours along with me.', 'Here!', 'Mistress!’\\n\\nPoor Clemency, with her apron to her eyes, came slowly in, escorted by\\nher husband; the latter doleful with the presentiment, that if she\\nabandoned herself to grief, the Nutmeg-Grater was done for.', '‘Now, Mistress,’ said the lawyer, checking Marion as she ran towards her,\\nand interposing himself between them, ‘what’s the matter with _you_?’\\n\\n‘The matter!’ cried poor Clemency.—When, looking up in wonder, and in\\nindignant remonstrance, and in the added emotion of a great roar from Mr.\\nBritain, and seeing that sweet face so well remembered close before her,\\nshe stared, sobbed, laughed, cried, screamed, embraced her, held her\\nfast, released her, fell on Mr. Snitchey and embraced him (much to Mrs.\\nSnitchey’s indignation), fell on the Doctor and embraced him, fell on Mr.\\nBritain and embraced him, and concluded by embracing herself, throwing\\nher apron over her head, and going into hysterics behind it.', 'A stranger had come into the orchard, after Mr. Snitchey, and had\\nremained apart, near the gate, without being observed by any of the\\ngroup; for they had little spare attention to bestow, and that had been\\nmonopolised by the ecstasies of Clemency.', 'He did not appear to wish to\\nbe observed, but stood alone, with downcast eyes; and there was an air of\\ndejection about him (though he was a gentleman of a gallant appearance)\\nwhich the general happiness rendered more remarkable.', 'None but the quick eyes of Aunt Martha, however, remarked him at all;\\nbut, almost as soon as she espied him, she was in conversation with him.', 'Presently, going to where Marion stood with Grace and her little\\nnamesake, she whispered something in Marion’s ear, at which she started,\\nand appeared surprised; but soon recovering from her confusion, she\\ntimidly approached the stranger, in Aunt Martha’s company, and engaged in\\nconversation with him too.', '‘Mr.', 'Britain,’ said the lawyer, putting his hand in his pocket, and\\nbringing out a legal-looking document, while this was going on, ‘I\\ncongratulate you.', 'You are now the whole and sole proprietor of that\\nfreehold tenement, at present occupied and held by yourself as a licensed\\ntavern, or house of public entertainment, and commonly called or known by\\nthe sign of the Nutmeg-Grater.', 'Your wife lost one house, through my\\nclient Mr. Michael Warden; and now gains another.', 'I shall have the\\npleasure of canvassing you for the county, one of these fine mornings.’\\n\\n‘Would it make any difference in the vote if the sign was altered, sir?’\\nasked Britain.', '‘Not in the least,’ replied the lawyer.', '‘Then,’ said Mr. Britain, handing him back the conveyance, ‘just clap in\\nthe words, “and Thimble,” will you be so good; and I’ll have the two\\nmottoes painted up in the parlour instead of my wife’s portrait.’\\n\\n‘And let me,’ said a voice behind them; it was the stranger’s—Michael\\nWarden’s; ‘let me claim the benefit of those inscriptions.', 'Mr.\\nHeathfield and Dr. Jeddler, I might have deeply wronged you both.', 'That I\\ndid not, is no virtue of my own.', 'I will not say that I am six years\\nwiser than I was, or better.', 'But I have known, at any rate, that term of\\nself-reproach.', 'I can urge no reason why you should deal gently with me.', 'I abused the hospitality of this house; and learnt by my own demerits,\\nwith a shame I never have forgotten, yet with some profit too, I would\\nfain hope, from one,’ he glanced at Marion, ‘to whom I made my humble\\nsupplication for forgiveness, when I knew her merit and my deep\\nunworthiness.', 'In a few days I shall quit this place for ever.', 'I entreat\\nyour pardon.', 'Do as you would be done by!', 'Forget and Forgive!’\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nTIME—from whom I had the latter portion of this story, and with whom I\\nhave the pleasure of a personal acquaintance of some five-and-thirty\\nyears’ duration—informed me, leaning easily upon his scythe, that Michael\\nWarden never went away again, and never sold his house, but opened it\\nafresh, maintained a golden means of hospitality, and had a wife, the\\npride and honour of that countryside, whose name was Marion.', 'But, as I\\nhave observed that Time confuses facts

I—Chirp the First\\n\\n\\nThe kettle began it!', 'Don’t tell me what Mrs. Peerybingle said.', 'I know\\nbetter.', 'Mrs. Peerybingle may leave it on record to the end of time that\\nshe couldn’t say which of them began it; but, I say the kettle did.', 'I\\nought to know, I hope!', 'The kettle began it, full five minutes by the\\nlittle waxy-faced Dutch clock in the corner, before the Cricket uttered a\\nchirp.', 'As if the clock hadn’t finished striking, and the convulsive little\\nHaymaker at the top of it, jerking away right and left with a scythe in\\nfront of a Moorish Palace, hadn’t mowed down half an acre of imaginary\\ngrass before the Cricket joined in at all!', 'Why, I am not naturally positive.', 'Every one knows that.', 'I wouldn’t set\\nmy own opinion against the opinion of Mrs. Peerybingle, unless I were\\nquite sure, on any account whatever.', 'Nothing should induce me.', 'But,\\nthis is a question of fact.', 'And the fact is, that the kettle began it, at\\nleast five minutes before the Cricket gave any sign of being in\\nexistence.', 'Contradict me, and I’ll say ten.', 'Let me narrate exactly how it happened.', 'I should have proceeded to do so\\nin my very first word, but for this plain consideration—if I am to tell a\\nstory I must begin at the beginning; and how is it possible to begin at\\nthe beginning, without beginning at the kettle?', 'It appeared as if there were a sort of match, or trial of skill, you must\\nunderstand, between the kettle and the Cricket.', 'And this is what led to\\nit, and how it came about.', 'Mrs. Peerybingle, going out into the raw twilight, and clicking over the\\nwet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable rough impressions\\nof the first proposition in Euclid all about the yard—Mrs.', 'Peerybingle\\nfilled the kettle at the water-butt.', 'Presently returning, less the\\npattens (and a good deal less, for they were tall and Mrs. Peerybingle\\nwas but short), she set the kettle on the fire.', 'In doing which she lost\\nher temper, or mislaid it for an instant; for, the water being\\nuncomfortably cold, and in that slippy, slushy, sleety sort of state\\nwherein it seems to penetrate through every kind of substance, patten\\nrings included—had laid hold of Mrs. Peerybingle’s toes, and even\\nsplashed her legs.', 'And when we rather plume ourselves (with reason too)\\nupon our legs, and keep ourselves particularly neat in point of\\nstockings, we find this, for the moment, hard to bear.', 'Besides, the kettle was aggravating and obstinate.', 'It wouldn’t allow\\nitself to be adjusted on the top bar; it wouldn’t hear of accommodating\\nitself kindly to the knobs of coal; it _would_ lean forward with a\\ndrunken air, and dribble, a very Idiot of a kettle, on the hearth.', 'It\\nwas quarrelsome, and hissed and spluttered morosely at the fire.', 'To sum\\nup all, the lid, resisting Mrs. Peerybingle’s fingers, first of all\\nturned topsy-turvy, and then, with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of\\na better cause, dived sideways in—down to the very bottom of the kettle.', 'And the hull of the Royal George has never made half the monstrous\\nresistance to coming out of the water, which the lid of that kettle\\nemployed against Mrs. Peerybingle, before she got it up again.', 'It looked sullen and pig-headed enough, even then; carrying its handle\\nwith an air of defiance, and cocking its spout pertly and mockingly at\\nMrs. Peerybingle, as if it said, ‘I won’t boil.', 'Nothing shall induce\\nme!’\\n\\nBut Mrs. Peerybingle, with restored good humour, dusted her chubby little\\nhands against each other, and sat down before the kettle, laughing.', 'Meantime, the jolly blaze uprose and fell, flashing and gleaming on the\\nlittle Haymaker at the top of the Dutch clock, until one might have\\nthought he stood stock still before the Moorish Palace, and nothing was\\nin motion but the flame.', 'He was on the move, however; and had his spasms, two to the second, all\\nright and regular.', 'But, his sufferings when the clock was going to\\nstrike, were frightful to behold; and, when a Cuckoo looked out of a\\ntrap-door in the Palace, and gave note six times, it shook him, each\\ntime, like a spectral voice—or like a something wiry, plucking at his\\nlegs.', 'It was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise among the\\nweights and ropes below him had quite subsided, that this terrified\\nHaymaker became himself again.', 'Nor was he startled without reason; for\\nthese rattling, bony skeletons of clocks are very disconcerting in their\\noperation, and I wonder very much how any set of men, but most of all how\\nDutchmen, can have had a liking to invent them.', 'There is a popular\\nbelief that Dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for their own\\nlower selves; and they might know better than to leave their clocks so\\nvery lank and unprotected, surely.', 'Now it was, you observe, that the kettle began to spend the evening.', 'Now\\nit was, that the kettle, growing mellow and musical, began to have\\nirrepressible gurglings in its throat, and to indulge in short vocal\\nsnorts, which it checked in the bud, as if it hadn’t quite made up its\\nmind yet, to be good company.', 'Now it was, that after two or three such\\nvain attempts to stifle its convivial sentiments, it threw off all\\nmoroseness, all reserve, and burst into a stream of song so cosy and\\nhilarious, as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of.', 'So plain too!', 'Bless you, you might have understood it like a book—better\\nthan some books you and I could name, perhaps.', 'With its warm breath\\ngushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a\\nfew feet, then hung about the chimney-corner as its own domestic Heaven,\\nit trolled its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness, that its\\niron body hummed and stirred upon the fire; and the lid itself, the\\nrecently rebellious lid—such is the influence of a bright\\nexample—performed a sort of jig, and clattered like a deaf and dumb young\\ncymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother.', 'That this song of the kettle’s was a song of invitation and welcome to\\nsomebody out of doors: to somebody at that moment coming on, towards the\\nsnug small home and the crisp fire: there is no doubt whatever.', 'Mrs.\\nPeerybingle knew it, perfectly, as she sat musing before the hearth.', 'It’s a dark night, sang the kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by\\nthe way; and, above, all is mist and darkness, and, below, all is mire\\nand clay; and there’s only one relief in all the sad and murky air; and I\\ndon’t know that it is one, for it’s nothing but a glare; of deep and\\nangry crimson, where the sun and wind together; set a brand upon the\\nclouds for being guilty of such weather; and the widest open country is a\\nlong dull streak of black; and there’s hoar-frost on the finger-post, and\\nthaw upon the track; and the ice it isn’t water, and the water isn’t\\nfree; and you couldn’t say that anything is what it ought to be; but he’s\\ncoming, coming, coming!—\\n\\nAnd here, if you like, the Cricket DID chime in!', 'with a Chirrup, Chirrup,\\nChirrup of such magnitude, by way of chorus; with a voice so astoundingly\\ndisproportionate to its size, as compared with the kettle; (size!', 'you\\ncouldn’t see it!)', 'that if it had then and there burst itself like an\\novercharged gun, if it had fallen a victim on the spot, and chirruped its\\nlittle body into fifty pieces, it would have seemed a natural and\\ninevitable consequence, for which it had expressly laboured.', 'The kettle had had the last of its solo performance.', 'It persevered with\\nundiminished ardour; but the Cricket took first fiddle and kept it.', 'Good\\nHeaven, how it chirped!', 'Its shrill, sharp, piercing voice resounded\\nthrough the house, and seemed to twinkle in the outer darkness like a\\nstar.', 'There was an indescribable little trill and tremble in it, at its\\nloudest, which suggested its being carried off its legs, and made to leap\\nagain, by its own intense enthusiasm.', 'Yet they went very well together,\\nthe Cricket and the kettle.', 'The burden of the song was still the same;\\nand louder, louder, louder still, they sang it in their emulation.', 'The fair little listener—for fair she was, and young: though something of\\nwhat is called the dumpling shape; but I don’t myself object to\\nthat—lighted a candle, glanced at the Haymaker on the top of the clock,\\nwho was getting in a pretty average crop of minutes; and looked out of\\nthe window, where she saw nothing, owing to the darkness, but her own\\nface imaged in the glass.', 'And my opinion is (and so would yours have\\nbeen), that she might have looked a long way, and seen nothing half so\\nagreeable.', 'When she came back, and sat down in her former seat, the\\nCricket and the kettle were still keeping it up, with a perfect fury of\\ncompetition.', 'The kettle’s weak side clearly being, that he didn’t know\\nwhen he was beat.', 'There was all the excitement of a race about it.', 'Chirp, chirp, chirp!', 'Cricket a mile ahead.', 'Hum, hum, hum—m—m!', 'Kettle making play in the\\ndistance, like a great top.', 'Chirp, chirp, chirp!', 'Cricket round the\\ncorner.', 'Hum, hum, hum—m—m!', 'Kettle sticking to him in his own way; no\\nidea of giving in.', 'Chirp, chirp, chirp!', 'Cricket fresher than ever.', 'Hum, hum, hum—m—m!', 'Kettle slow and steady.', 'Chirp, chirp, chirp!', 'Cricket going in to finish him.', 'Hum, hum, hum—m—m!', 'Kettle not to be\\nfinished.', 'Until at last they got so jumbled together, in the\\nhurry-skurry, helter-skelter, of the match, that whether the kettle\\nchirped and the Cricket hummed, or the Cricket chirped and the kettle\\nhummed, or they both chirped and both hummed, it would have taken a\\nclearer head than yours or mine to have decided with anything like\\ncertainty.', 'But, of this, there is no doubt: that, the kettle and the\\nCricket, at one and the same moment, and by some power of amalgamation\\nbest known to themselves, sent, each, his fireside song of comfort\\nstreaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window, and\\na long way down the lane.', 'And this light, bursting on a certain person\\nwho, on the instant, approached towards it through the gloom, expressed\\nthe whole thing to him, literally in a twinkling, and cried, ‘Welcome\\nhome, old fellow!', 'Welcome home, my boy!’\\n\\nThis end attained, the kettle, being dead beat, boiled over, and was\\ntaken off the fire.', 'Mrs. Peerybingle then went running to the door,\\nwhere, what with the wheels of a cart, the tramp of a horse, the voice of\\na man, the tearing in and out of an excited dog, and the surprising and\\nmysterious appearance of a baby, there was soon the very What’s-his-name\\nto pay.', 'Where the baby came from, or how Mrs. Peerybingle got hold of it in that\\nflash of time, _I_ don’t know.', 'But a live baby there was, in Mrs.\\nPeerybingle’s arms; and a pretty tolerable amount of pride she seemed to\\nhave in it, when she was drawn gently to the fire, by a sturdy figure of\\na man, much taller and much older than herself, who had to stoop a long\\nway down, to kiss her.', 'But she was worth the trouble.', 'Six foot six,\\nwith the lumbago, might have done it.', '‘Oh goodness, John!’ said Mrs. P.  ‘What a state you are in with the\\nweather!’\\n\\nHe was something the worse for it, undeniably.', 'The thick mist hung in\\nclots upon his eyelashes like candied thaw; and between the fog and fire\\ntogether, there were rainbows in his very whiskers.', '‘Why, you see, Dot,’ John made answer, slowly, as he unrolled a shawl\\nfrom about his throat; and warmed his hands; ‘it—it an’t exactly summer\\nweather.', 'So, no wonder.’\\n\\n‘I wish you wouldn’t call me Dot, John.', 'I don’t like it,’ said Mrs.\\nPeerybingle: pouting in a way that clearly showed she _did_ like it, very\\nmuch.', '‘Why what else are you?’ returned John, looking down upon her with a\\nsmile, and giving her waist as light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm\\ncould give.', '‘A dot and’—here he glanced at the baby—‘a dot and carry—I\\nwon’t say it, for fear I should spoil it; but I was very near a joke.', 'I\\ndon’t know as ever I was nearer.’\\n\\nHe was often near to something or other very clever, by his own account:\\nthis lumbering, slow, honest John; this John so heavy, but so light of\\nspirit; so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core; so dull\\nwithout, so quick within; so stolid, but so good!', 'Oh Mother Nature, give\\nthy children the true poetry of heart that hid itself in this poor\\nCarrier’s breast—he was but a Carrier by the way—and we can bear to have\\nthem talking prose, and leading lives of prose; and bear to bless thee\\nfor their company!', 'It was pleasant to see Dot, with her little figure, and her baby in her\\narms: a very doll of a baby: glancing with a coquettish thoughtfulness at\\nthe fire, and inclining her delicate little head just enough on one side\\nto let it rest in an odd, half-natural, half-affected, wholly nestling\\nand agreeable manner, on the great rugged figure of the Carrier.', 'It was\\npleasant to see him, with his tender awkwardness, endeavouring to adapt\\nhis rude support to her slight need, and make his burly middle-age a\\nleaning-staff not inappropriate to her blooming youth.', 'It was pleasant\\nto observe how Tilly Slowboy, waiting in the background for the baby,\\ntook special cognizance (though in her earliest teens) of this grouping;\\nand stood with her mouth and eyes wide open, and her head thrust forward,\\ntaking it in as if it were air.', 'Nor was it less agreeable to observe how\\nJohn the Carrier, reference being made by Dot to the aforesaid baby,\\nchecked his hand when on the point of touching the infant, as if he\\nthought he might crack it; and bending down, surveyed it from a safe\\ndistance, with a kind of puzzled pride, such as an amiable mastiff might\\nbe supposed to show, if he found himself, one day, the father of a young\\ncanary.', '‘An’t he beautiful, John?', 'Don’t he look precious in his sleep?’\\n\\n‘Very precious,’ said John.', '‘Very much so.', 'He generally _is_ asleep,\\nan’t he?’\\n\\n‘Lor, John!', 'Good gracious no!’\\n\\n‘Oh,’ said John, pondering.', '‘I thought his eyes was generally shut.', 'Halloa!’\\n\\n‘Goodness, John, how you startle one!’\\n\\n‘It an’t right for him to turn ’em up in that way!’ said the astonished\\nCarrier, ‘is it?', 'See how he’s winking with both of ’em at once!', 'And\\nlook at his mouth!', 'Why he’s gasping like a gold and silver fish!’\\n\\n‘You don’t deserve to be a father, you don’t,’ said Dot, with all the\\ndignity of an experienced matron.', '‘But how should you know what little\\ncomplaints children are troubled with, John!', 'You wouldn’t so much as\\nknow their names, you stupid fellow.’  And when she had turned the baby\\nover on her left arm, and had slapped its back as a restorative, she\\npinched her husband’s ear, laughing.', '‘No,’ said John, pulling off his outer coat.', '‘It’s very true, Dot.', 'I\\ndon’t know much about it.', 'I only know that I’ve been fighting pretty\\nstiffly with the wind to-night.', 'It’s been blowing north-east, straight\\ninto the cart, the whole way home.’\\n\\n‘Poor old man, so it has!’ cried Mrs. Peerybingle, instantly becoming\\nvery active.', '‘Here!', 'Take the precious darling, Tilly, while I make\\nmyself of some use.', 'Bless it, I could smother it with kissing it, I\\ncould!', 'Hie then, good dog!', 'Hie, Boxer, boy!', 'Only let me make the tea\\nfirst, John; and then I’ll help you with the parcels, like a busy bee.', '“How doth the little”—and all the rest of it, you know, John.', 'Did you\\never learn “how doth the little,” when you went to school, John?’\\n\\n‘Not to quite know it,’ John returned.', '‘I was very near it once.', 'But I\\nshould only have spoilt it, I dare say.’\\n\\n‘Ha ha,’ laughed Dot.', 'She had the blithest little laugh you ever heard.', '‘What a dear old darling of a dunce you are, John, to be sure!’\\n\\nNot at all disputing this position, John went out to see that the boy\\nwith the lantern, which had been dancing to and fro before the door and\\nwindow, like a Will of the Wisp, took due care of the horse; who was\\nfatter than you would quite believe, if I gave you his measure, and so\\nold that his birthday was lost in the mists of antiquity.', 'Boxer, feeling\\nthat his attentions were due to the family in general, and must be\\nimpartially distributed, dashed in and out with bewildering inconstancy;\\nnow, describing a circle of short barks round the horse, where he was\\nbeing rubbed down at the stable-door; now feigning to make savage rushes\\nat his mistress, and facetiously bringing himself to sudden stops; now,\\neliciting a shriek from Tilly Slowboy, in the low nursing-chair near the\\nfire, by the unexpected application of his moist nose to her countenance;\\nnow, exhibiting an obtrusive interest in the baby; now, going round and\\nround upon the hearth, and lying down as if he had established himself\\nfor the night; now, getting up again, and taking that nothing of a\\nfag-end of a tail of his, out into the weather, as if he had just\\nremembered an appointment, and was off, at a round trot, to keep it.', '‘There!', 'There’s the teapot, ready on the hob!’ said Dot; as briskly busy\\nas a child at play at keeping house.', '‘And there’s the old knuckle of\\nham; and there’s the butter; and there’s the crusty loaf, and all!', 'Here’s the clothes-basket for the small parcels, John, if you’ve got any\\nthere—where are you, John?’\\n\\n‘Don’t let the dear child fall under the grate, Tilly, whatever you do!’\\n\\nIt may be noted of Miss Slowboy, in spite of her rejecting the caution\\nwith some vivacity, that she had a rare and surprising talent for getting\\nthis baby into difficulties and had several times imperilled its short\\nlife, in a quiet way peculiarly her own.', 'She was of a spare and straight\\nshape, this young lady, insomuch that her garments appeared to be in\\nconstant danger of sliding off those sharp pegs, her shoulders, on which\\nthey were loosely hung.', 'Her costume was remarkable for the partial\\ndevelopment, on all possible occasions, of some flannel vestment of a\\nsingular structure; also for affording glimpses, in the region of the\\nback, of a corset, or pair of stays, in colour a dead-green.', 'Being\\nalways in a state of gaping admiration at everything, and absorbed,\\nbesides, in the perpetual contemplation of her mistress’s perfections and\\nthe baby’s, Miss Slowboy, in her little errors of judgment, may be said\\nto have done equal honour to her head and to her heart; and though these\\ndid less honour to the baby’s head, which they were the occasional means\\nof bringing into contact with deal doors, dressers, stair-rails,\\nbed-posts, and other foreign substances, still they were the honest\\nresults of Tilly Slowboy’s constant astonishment at finding herself so\\nkindly treated, and installed in such a comfortable home.', 'For, the\\nmaternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to Fame, and Tilly had\\nbeen bred by public charity, a foundling; which word, though only\\ndiffering from fondling by one vowel’s length, is very different in\\nmeaning, and expresses quite another thing.', 'To have seen little Mrs. Peerybingle come back with her husband, tugging\\nat the clothes-basket, and making the most strenuous exertions to do\\nnothing at all (for he carried it), would have amused you almost as much\\nas it amused him.', 'It may have entertained the Cricket too, for anything\\nI know; but, certainly, it now began to chirp again, vehemently.', '‘Heyday!’ said John, in his slow way.', '‘It’s merrier than ever, to-night,\\nI think.’\\n\\n‘And it’s sure to bring us good fortune, John!', 'It always has done so.', 'To have a Cricket on the Hearth, is the luckiest thing in all the world!’\\n\\nJohn looked at her as if he had very nearly got the thought into his\\nhead, that she was his Cricket in chief, and he quite agreed with her.', 'But, it was probably one of his narrow escapes, for he said nothing.', '‘The first time I heard its cheerful little note, John, was on that night\\nwhen you brought me home—when you brought me to my new home here; its\\nlittle mistress.', 'Nearly a year ago.', 'You recollect, John?’\\n\\nO yes.', 'John remembered.', 'I should think so!', '‘Its chirp was such a welcome to me!', 'It seemed so full of promise and\\nencouragement.', 'It seemed to say, you would be kind and gentle with me,\\nand would not expect (I had a fear of that, John, then) to find an old\\nhead on the shoulders of your foolish little wife.’\\n\\nJohn thoughtfully patted one of the shoulders, and then the head, as\\nthough he would have said No, no; he had had no such expectation; he had\\nbeen quite content to take them as they were.', 'And really he had reason.', 'They were very comely.', '‘It spoke the truth, John, when it seemed to say so; for you have ever\\nbeen, I am sure, the best, the most considerate, the most affectionate of\\nhusbands to me.', 'This has been a happy home, John; and I love the Cricket\\nfor its sake!’\\n\\n‘Why so do I then,’ said the Carrier.', '‘So do I, Dot.’\\n\\n‘I love it for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its\\nharmless music has given me.', 'Sometimes, in the twilight, when I have\\nfelt a little solitary and down-hearted, John—before baby was here to\\nkeep me company and make the house gay—when I have thought how lonely you\\nwould be if I should die; how lonely I should be if I could know that you\\nhad lost me, dear; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp upon the hearth, has seemed to\\ntell me of another little voice, so sweet, so very dear to me, before\\nwhose coming sound my trouble vanished like a dream.', 'And when I used to\\nfear—I did fear once, John, I was very young you know—that ours might\\nprove to be an ill-assorted marriage, I being such a child, and you more\\nlike my guardian than my husband; and that you might not, however hard\\nyou tried, be able to learn to love me, as you hoped and prayed you\\nmight; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp has cheered me up again, and filled me\\nwith new trust and confidence.', 'I was thinking of these things to-night,\\ndear, when I sat expecting you; and I love the Cricket for their sake!’\\n\\n‘And so do I,’ repeated John.', '‘But, Dot?', '_I_ hope and pray that I might\\nlearn to love you?', 'How you talk!', 'I had learnt that, long before I\\nbrought you here, to be the Cricket’s little mistress, Dot!’\\n\\nShe laid her hand, an instant, on his arm, and looked up at him with an\\nagitated face, as if she would have told him something.', 'Next moment she\\nwas down upon her knees before the basket, speaking in a sprightly voice,\\nand busy with the parcels.', '‘There are not many of them to-night, John, but I saw some goods behind\\nthe cart, just now; and though they give more trouble, perhaps, still\\nthey pay as well; so we have no reason to grumble, have we?', 'Besides, you\\nhave been delivering, I dare say, as you came along?’\\n\\n‘Oh yes,’ John said.', '‘A good many.’\\n\\n‘Why what’s this round box?', 'Heart alive, John, it’s a wedding-cake!’\\n\\n‘Leave a woman alone to find out that,’ said John, admiringly.', '‘Now a\\nman would never have thought of it.', 'Whereas, it’s my belief that if you\\nwas to pack a wedding-cake up in a tea-chest, or a turn-up bedstead, or a\\npickled salmon keg, or any unlikely thing, a woman would be sure to find\\nit out directly.', 'Yes; I called for it at the pastry-cook’s.’\\n\\n‘And it weighs I don’t know what—whole hundredweights!’ cried Dot, making\\na great demonstration of trying to lift it.', '‘Whose is it, John?', 'Where is it going?’\\n\\n‘Read the writing on the other side,’ said John.', '‘Why, John!', 'My Goodness, John!’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'who’d have thought it!’ John returned.', '‘You never mean to say,’ pursued Dot, sitting on the floor and shaking\\nher head at him, ‘that it’s Gruff and Tackleton the toymaker!’\\n\\nJohn nodded.', 'Mrs. Peerybingle nodded also, fifty times at least.', 'Not in assent—in\\ndumb and pitying amazement; screwing up her lips the while with all their\\nlittle force (they were never made for screwing up; I am clear of that),\\nand looking the good Carrier through and through, in her abstraction.', 'Miss Slowboy, in the mean time, who had a mechanical power of reproducing\\nscraps of current conversation for the delectation of the baby, with all\\nthe sense struck out of them, and all the nouns changed into the plural\\nnumber, inquired aloud of that young creature, Was it Gruffs and\\nTackletons the toymakers then, and Would it call at Pastry-cooks for\\nwedding-cakes, and Did its mothers know the boxes when its fathers\\nbrought them homes; and so on.', '‘And that is really to come about!’ said Dot.', '‘Why, she and I were girls\\nat school together, John.’\\n\\nHe might have been thinking of her, or nearly thinking of her, perhaps,\\nas she was in that same school time.', 'He looked upon her with a\\nthoughtful pleasure, but he made no answer.', '‘And he’s as old!', 'As unlike her!—Why, how many years older than you, is\\nGruff and Tackleton, John?’\\n\\n‘How many more cups of tea shall I drink to-night at one sitting, than\\nGruff and Tackleton ever took in four, I wonder!’ replied John,\\ngood-humouredly, as he drew a chair to the round table, and began at the\\ncold ham.', '‘As to eating, I eat but little; but that little I enjoy,\\nDot.’\\n\\nEven this, his usual sentiment at meal times, one of his innocent\\ndelusions (for his appetite was always obstinate, and flatly contradicted\\nhim), awoke no smile in the face of his little wife, who stood among the\\nparcels, pushing the cake-box slowly from her with her foot, and never\\nonce looked, though her eyes were cast down too, upon the dainty shoe she\\ngenerally was so mindful of.', 'Absorbed in thought, she stood there,\\nheedless alike of the tea and John (although he called to her, and rapped\\nthe table with his knife to startle her), until he rose and touched her\\non the arm; when she looked at him for a moment, and hurried to her place\\nbehind the teaboard, laughing at her negligence.', 'But, not as she had\\nlaughed before.', 'The manner and the music were quite changed.', 'The Cricket, too, had stopped.', 'Somehow the room was not so cheerful as\\nit had been.', 'Nothing like it.', '‘So, these are all the parcels, are they, John?’ she said, breaking a\\nlong silence, which the honest Carrier had devoted to the practical\\nillustration of one part of his favourite sentiment—certainly enjoying\\nwhat he ate, if it couldn’t be admitted that he ate but little.', '‘So,\\nthese are all the parcels; are they, John?’\\n\\n‘That’s all,’ said John.', '‘Why—no—I—’ laying down his knife and fork, and\\ntaking a long breath.', '‘I declare—I’ve clean forgotten the old\\ngentleman!’\\n\\n‘The old gentleman?’\\n\\n‘In the cart,’ said John.', '‘He was asleep, among the straw, the last time\\nI saw him.', 'I’ve very nearly remembered him, twice, since I came in; but\\nhe went out of my head again.', 'Halloa!', 'Yahip there!', 'Rouse up!', 'That’s\\nmy hearty!’\\n\\nJohn said these latter words outside the door, whither he had hurried\\nwith the candle in his hand.', 'Miss Slowboy, conscious of some mysterious reference to The Old\\nGentleman, and connecting in her mystified imagination certain\\nassociations of a religious nature with the phrase, was so disturbed,\\nthat hastily rising from the low chair by the fire to seek protection\\nnear the skirts of her mistress, and coming into contact as she crossed\\nthe doorway with an ancient Stranger, she instinctively made a charge or\\nbutt at him with the only offensive instrument within her reach.', 'This\\ninstrument happening to be the baby, great commotion and alarm ensued,\\nwhich the sagacity of Boxer rather tended to increase; for, that good\\ndog, more thoughtful than its master, had, it seemed, been watching the\\nold gentleman in his sleep, lest he should walk off with a few young\\npoplar trees that were tied up behind the cart; and he still attended on\\nhim very closely, worrying his gaiters in fact, and making dead sets at\\nthe buttons.', '‘You’re such an undeniable good sleeper, sir,’ said John, when\\ntranquillity was restored; in the mean time the old gentleman had stood,\\nbareheaded and motionless, in the centre of the room; ‘that I have half a\\nmind to ask you where the other six are—only that would be a joke, and I\\nknow I should spoil it.', 'Very near though,’ murmured the Carrier, with a\\nchuckle; ‘very near!’\\n\\nThe Stranger, who had long white hair, good features, singularly bold and\\nwell defined for an old man, and dark, bright, penetrating eyes, looked\\nround with a smile, and saluted the Carrier’s wife by gravely inclining\\nhis head.', 'His garb was very quaint and odd—a long, long way behind the time.', 'Its\\nhue was brown, all over.', 'In his hand he held a great brown club or\\nwalking-stick; and striking this upon the floor, it fell asunder, and\\nbecame a chair.', 'On which he sat down, quite composedly.', '‘There!’ said the Carrier, turning to his wife.', '‘That’s the way I found\\nhim, sitting by the roadside!', 'Upright as a milestone.', 'And almost as\\ndeaf.’\\n\\n‘Sitting in the open air, John!’\\n\\n‘In the open air,’ replied the Carrier, ‘just at dusk.', '“Carriage Paid,”\\nhe said; and gave me eighteenpence.', 'Then he got in.', 'And there he is.’\\n\\n‘He’s going, John, I think!’\\n\\nNot at all.', 'He was only going to speak.', '‘If you please, I was to be left till called for,’ said the Stranger,\\nmildly.', '‘Don’t mind me.’\\n\\nWith that, he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets,\\nand a book from another, and leisurely began to read.', 'Making no more of\\nBoxer than if he had been a house lamb!', 'The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity.', 'The Stranger\\nraised his head; and glancing from the latter to the former, said,\\n\\n‘Your daughter, my good friend?’\\n\\n‘Wife,’ returned John.', '‘Niece?’ said the Stranger.', '‘Wife,’ roared John.', '‘Indeed?’ observed the Stranger.', '‘Surely?', 'Very young!’\\n\\nHe quietly turned over, and resumed his reading.', 'But, before he could\\nhave read two lines, he again interrupted himself to say:\\n\\n‘Baby, yours?’\\n\\nJohn gave him a gigantic nod; equivalent to an answer in the affirmative,\\ndelivered through a speaking trumpet.', '‘Girl?’\\n\\n‘Bo-o-oy!’ roared John.', '‘Also very young, eh?’\\n\\nMrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in.', '‘Two months and three da-ays!', 'Vaccinated just six weeks ago-o!', 'Took very fine-ly!', 'Considered, by the\\ndoctor, a remarkably beautiful chi-ild!', 'Equal to the general run of\\nchildren at five months o-old!', 'Takes notice, in a way quite won-der-ful!', 'May seem impossible to you, but feels his legs al-ready!’\\n\\nHere the breathless little mother, who had been shrieking these short\\nsentences into the old man’s ear, until her pretty face was crimsoned,\\nheld up the Baby before him as a stubborn and triumphant fact; while\\nTilly Slowboy, with a melodious cry of ‘Ketcher, Ketcher’—which sounded\\nlike some unknown words, adapted to a popular Sneeze—performed some\\ncow-like gambols round that all unconscious Innocent.', '‘Hark!', 'He’s called for, sure enough,’ said John.', '‘There’s somebody at\\nthe door.', 'Open it, Tilly.’\\n\\nBefore she could reach it, however, it was opened from without; being a\\nprimitive sort of door, with a latch, that any one could lift if he\\nchose—and a good many people did choose, for all kinds of neighbours\\nliked to have a cheerful word or two with the Carrier, though he was no\\ngreat talker himself.', 'Being opened, it gave admission to a little,\\nmeagre, thoughtful, dingy-faced man, who seemed to have made himself a\\ngreat-coat from the sack-cloth covering of some old box; for, when he\\nturned to shut the door, and keep the weather out, he disclosed upon the\\nback of that garment, the inscription G & T in large black capitals.', 'Also the word GLASS in bold characters.', '‘Good evening, John!’ said the little man.', '‘Good evening, Mum.', 'Good\\nevening, Tilly.', 'Good evening, Unbeknown!', 'How’s Baby, Mum?', 'Boxer’s\\npretty well I hope?’\\n\\n‘All thriving, Caleb,’ replied Dot.', '‘I am sure you need only look at the\\ndear child, for one, to know that.’\\n\\n‘And I’m sure I need only look at you for another,’ said Caleb.', 'He didn’t look at her though; he had a wandering and thoughtful eye which\\nseemed to be always projecting itself into some other time and place, no\\nmatter what he said; a description which will equally apply to his voice.', '‘Or at John for another,’ said Caleb.', '‘Or at Tilly, as far as that goes.', 'Or certainly at Boxer.’\\n\\n‘Busy just now, Caleb?’ asked the Carrier.', '‘Why, pretty well, John,’ he returned, with the distraught air of a man\\nwho was casting about for the Philosopher’s stone, at least.', '‘Pretty\\nmuch so.', 'There’s rather a run on Noah’s Arks at present.', 'I could have\\nwished to improve upon the Family, but I don’t see how it’s to be done at\\nthe price.', 'It would be a satisfaction to one’s mind, to make it clearer\\nwhich was Shems and Hams, and which was Wives.', 'Flies an’t on that scale\\nneither, as compared with elephants you know!', 'Ah!', 'well!', 'Have you got\\nanything in the parcel line for me, John?’\\n\\nThe Carrier put his hand into a pocket of the coat he had taken off; and\\nbrought out, carefully preserved in moss and paper, a tiny flower-pot.', '‘There it is!’ he said, adjusting it with great care.', '‘Not so much as a\\nleaf damaged.', 'Full of buds!’\\n\\nCaleb’s dull eye brightened, as he took it, and thanked him.', '‘Dear, Caleb,’ said the Carrier.', '‘Very dear at this season.’\\n\\n‘Never mind that.', 'It would be cheap to me, whatever it cost,’ returned\\nthe little man.', '‘Anything else, John?’\\n\\n‘A small box,’ replied the Carrier.', '‘Here you are!’\\n\\n‘“For Caleb Plummer,”’ said the little man, spelling out the direction.', '‘“With Cash.”  With Cash, John?', 'I don’t think it’s for me.’\\n\\n‘With Care,’ returned the Carrier, looking over his shoulder.', '‘Where do\\nyou make out cash?’\\n\\n‘Oh!', 'To be sure!’ said Caleb.', '‘It’s all right.', 'With care!', 'Yes, yes;\\nthat’s mine.', 'It might have been with cash, indeed, if my dear Boy in the\\nGolden South Americas had lived, John.', 'You loved him like a son; didn’t\\nyou?', 'You needn’t say you did.', '_I_ know, of course.', '“Caleb Plummer.', 'With care.”  Yes, yes, it’s all right.', 'It’s a box of dolls’ eyes for my\\ndaughter’s work.', 'I wish it was her own sight in a box, John.’\\n\\n‘I wish it was, or could be!’ cried the Carrier.', '‘Thank’ee,’ said the little man.', '‘You speak very hearty.', 'To think that\\nshe should never see the Dolls—and them a-staring at her, so bold, all\\nday long!', 'That’s where it cuts.', 'What’s the damage, John?’\\n\\n‘I’ll damage you,’ said John, ‘if you inquire.', 'Dot!', 'Very near?’\\n\\n‘Well!', 'it’s like you to say so,’ observed the little man.', '‘It’s your\\nkind way.', 'Let me see.', 'I think that’s all.’\\n\\n‘I think not,’ said the Carrier.', '‘Try again.’\\n\\n‘Something for our Governor, eh?’ said Caleb, after pondering a little\\nwhile.', '‘To be sure.', 'That’s what I came for; but my head’s so running on\\nthem Arks and things!', 'He hasn’t been here, has he?’\\n\\n‘Not he,’ returned the Carrier.', '‘He’s too busy, courting.’\\n\\n‘He’s coming round though,’ said Caleb; ‘for he told me to keep on the\\nnear side of the road going home, and it was ten to one he’d take me up.', 'I had better go, by the bye.—You couldn’t have the goodness to let me\\npinch Boxer’s tail, Mum, for half a moment, could you?’\\n\\n‘Why, Caleb!', 'what a question!’\\n\\n‘Oh never mind, Mum,’ said the little man.', '‘He mightn’t like it perhaps.', 'There’s a small order just come in, for barking dogs; and I should wish\\nto go as close to Natur’ as I could, for sixpence.', 'That’s all.', 'Never\\nmind, Mum.’\\n\\nIt happened opportunely, that Boxer, without receiving the proposed\\nstimulus, began to bark with great zeal.', 'But, as this implied the\\napproach of some new visitor, Caleb, postponing his study from the life\\nto a more convenient season, shouldered the round box, and took a hurried\\nleave.', 'He might have spared himself the trouble, for he met the visitor\\nupon the threshold.', '‘Oh!', 'You are here, are you?', 'Wait a bit.', 'I’ll take you home.', 'John\\nPeerybingle, my service to you.', 'More of my service to your pretty wife.', 'Handsomer every day!', 'Better too, if possible!', 'And younger,’ mused the\\nspeaker, in a low voice; ‘that’s the Devil of it!’\\n\\n‘I should be astonished at your paying compliments, Mr. Tackleton,’ said\\nDot, not with the best grace in the world; ‘but for your condition.’\\n\\n‘You know all about it then?’\\n\\n‘I have got myself to believe it, somehow,’ said Dot.', '‘After a hard struggle, I suppose?’\\n\\n‘Very.’\\n\\nTackleton the Toy-merchant, pretty generally known as Gruff and\\nTackleton—for that was the firm, though Gruff had been bought out long\\nago; only leaving his name, and as some said his nature, according to its\\nDictionary meaning, in the business—Tackleton the Toy-merchant, was a man\\nwhose vocation had been quite misunderstood by his Parents and Guardians.', 'If they had made him a Money Lender, or a sharp Attorney, or a Sheriff’s\\nOfficer, or a Broker, he might have sown his discontented oats in his\\nyouth, and, after having had the full run of himself in ill-natured\\ntransactions, might have turned out amiable, at last, for the sake of a\\nlittle freshness and novelty.', 'But, cramped and chafing in the peaceable\\npursuit of toy-making, he was a domestic Ogre, who had been living on\\nchildren all his life, and was their implacable enemy.', 'He despised all\\ntoys; wouldn’t have bought one for the world; delighted, in his malice,\\nto insinuate grim expressions into the faces of brown-paper farmers who\\ndrove pigs to market, bellmen who advertised lost lawyers’ consciences,\\nmovable old ladies who darned stockings or carved pies; and other like\\nsamples of his stock in trade.', 'In appalling masks; hideous, hairy,\\nred-eyed Jacks in Boxes; Vampire Kites; demoniacal Tumblers who wouldn’t\\nlie down, and were perpetually flying forward, to stare infants out of\\ncountenance; his soul perfectly revelled.', 'They were his only relief, and\\nsafety-valve.', 'He was great in such inventions.', 'Anything suggestive of a\\nPony-nightmare was delicious to him.', 'He had even lost money (and he took\\nto that toy very kindly) by getting up Goblin slides for magic-lanterns,\\nwhereon the Powers of Darkness were depicted as a sort of supernatural\\nshell-fish, with human faces.', 'In intensifying the portraiture of Giants,\\nhe had sunk quite a little capital; and, though no painter himself, he\\ncould indicate, for the instruction of his artists, with a piece of\\nchalk, a certain furtive leer for the countenances of those monsters,\\nwhich was safe to destroy the peace of mind of any young gentleman\\nbetween the ages of six and eleven, for the whole Christmas or Midsummer\\nVacation.', 'What he was in toys, he was (as most men are) in other things.', 'You may\\neasily suppose, therefore, that within the great green cape, which\\nreached down to the calves of his legs, there was buttoned up to the chin\\nan uncommonly pleasant fellow; and that he was about as choice a spirit,\\nand as agreeable a companion, as ever stood in a pair of\\nbull-headed-looking boots with mahogany-coloured tops.', 'Still, Tackleton, the toy-merchant, was going to be married.', 'In spite of\\nall this, he was going to be married.', 'And to a young wife too, a\\nbeautiful young wife.', 'He didn’t look much like a bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier’s\\nkitchen, with a twist in his dry face, and a screw in his body, and his\\nhat jerked over the bridge of his nose, and his hands tucked down into\\nthe bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self\\npeering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated\\nessence of any number of ravens.', 'But, a Bridegroom he designed to be.', '‘In three days’ time.', 'Next Thursday.', 'The last day of the first month in\\nthe year.', 'That’s my wedding-day,’ said Tackleton.', 'Did I mention that he had always one eye wide open, and one eye nearly\\nshut; and that the one eye nearly shut, was always the expressive eye?', 'I\\ndon’t think I did.', '‘That’s my wedding-day!’ said Tackleton, rattling his money.', '‘Why, it’s our wedding-day too,’ exclaimed the Carrier.', '‘Ha ha!’ laughed Tackleton.', '‘Odd!', 'You’re just such another couple.', 'Just!’\\n\\nThe indignation of Dot at this presumptuous assertion is not to be\\ndescribed.', 'What next?', 'His imagination would compass the possibility of\\njust such another Baby, perhaps.', 'The man was mad.', '‘I say!', 'A word with you,’ murmured Tackleton, nudging the Carrier with\\nhis elbow, and taking him a little apart.', '‘You’ll come to the wedding?', 'We’re in the same boat, you know.’\\n\\n‘How in the same boat?’ inquired the Carrier.', '‘A little disparity, you know,’ said Tackleton, with another nudge.', '‘Come and spend an evening with us, beforehand.’\\n\\n‘Why?’ demanded John, astonished at this pressing hospitality.', '‘Why?’ returned the other.', '‘That’s a new way of receiving an invitation.', 'Why, for pleasure—sociability, you know, and all that!’\\n\\n‘I thought you were never sociable,’ said John, in his plain way.', '‘Tchah!', 'It’s of no use to be anything but free with you, I see,’ said\\nTackleton.', '‘Why, then, the truth is you have a—what tea-drinking people\\ncall a sort of a comfortable appearance together, you and your wife.', 'We\\nknow better, you know, but—’\\n\\n‘No, we don’t know better,’ interposed John.', '‘What are you talking\\nabout?’\\n\\n‘Well!', 'We _don’t_ know better, then,’ said Tackleton.', '‘We’ll agree that\\nwe don’t.', 'As you like; what does it matter?', 'I was going to say, as you\\nhave that sort of appearance, your company will produce a favourable\\neffect on Mrs. Tackleton that will be.', 'And, though I don’t think your\\ngood lady’s very friendly to me, in this matter, still she can’t help\\nherself from falling into my views, for there’s a compactness and\\ncosiness of appearance about her that always tells, even in an\\nindifferent case.', 'You’ll say you’ll come?’\\n\\n‘We have arranged to keep our Wedding-Day (as far as that goes) at home,’\\nsaid John.', '‘We have made the promise to ourselves these six months.', 'We\\nthink, you see, that home—’\\n\\n‘Bah!', 'what’s home?’ cried Tackleton.', '‘Four walls and a ceiling!', '(why\\ndon’t you kill that Cricket?', '_I_ would!', 'I always do.', 'I hate their\\nnoise.)', 'There are four walls and a ceiling at my house.', 'Come to me!’\\n\\n‘You kill your Crickets, eh?’ said John.', '‘Scrunch ’em, sir,’ returned the other, setting his heel heavily on the\\nfloor.', '‘You’ll say you’ll come?', 'It’s as much your interest as mine, you\\nknow, that the women should persuade each other that they’re quiet and\\ncontented, and couldn’t be better off.', 'I know their way.', 'Whatever one\\nwoman says, another woman is determined to clinch, always.', 'There’s that\\nspirit of emulation among ’em, sir, that if your wife says to my wife,\\n“I’m the happiest woman in the world, and mine’s the best husband in the\\nworld, and I dote on him,” my wife will say the same to yours, or more,\\nand half believe it.’\\n\\n‘Do you mean to say she don’t, then?’ asked the Carrier.', '‘Don’t!’ cried Tackleton, with a short, sharp laugh.', '‘Don’t what?’\\n\\nThe Carrier had some faint idea of adding, ‘dote upon you.’  But,\\nhappening to meet the half-closed eye, as it twinkled upon him over the\\nturned-up collar of the cape, which was within an ace of poking it out,\\nhe felt it such an unlikely part and parcel of anything to be doted on,\\nthat he substituted, ‘that she don’t believe it?’\\n\\n‘Ah you dog!', 'You’re joking,’ said Tackleton.', 'But the Carrier, though slow to understand the full drift of his meaning,\\neyed him in such a serious manner, that he was obliged to be a little\\nmore explanatory.', '‘I have the humour,’ said Tackleton: holding up the fingers of his left\\nhand, and tapping the forefinger, to imply ‘there I am, Tackleton to\\nwit:’ ‘I have the humour, sir, to marry a young wife, and a pretty wife:’\\nhere he rapped his little finger, to express the Bride; not sparingly,\\nbut sharply; with a sense of power.', '‘I’m able to gratify that humour and\\nI do.', 'It’s my whim.', 'But—now look there!’\\n\\nHe pointed to where Dot was sitting, thoughtfully, before the fire;\\nleaning her dimpled chin upon her hand, and watching the bright blaze.', 'The Carrier looked at her, and then at him, and then at her, and then at\\nhim again.', '‘She honours and obeys, no doubt, you know,’ said Tackleton; ‘and that,\\nas I am not a man of sentiment, is quite enough for _me_.', 'But do you\\nthink there’s anything more in it?’\\n\\n‘I think,’ observed the Carrier, ‘that I should chuck any man out of\\nwindow, who said there wasn’t.’\\n\\n‘Exactly so,’ returned the other with an unusual alacrity of assent.', '‘To\\nbe sure!', 'Doubtless you would.', 'Of course.', 'I’m certain of it.', 'Good\\nnight.', 'Pleasant dreams!’\\n\\nThe Carrier was puzzled, and made uncomfortable and uncertain, in spite\\nof himself.', 'He couldn’t help showing it, in his manner.', '‘Good night, my dear friend!’ said Tackleton, compassionately.', '‘I’m off.', 'We’re exactly alike, in reality, I see.', 'You won’t give us to-morrow\\nevening?', 'Well!', 'Next day you go out visiting, I know.', 'I’ll meet you\\nthere, and bring my wife that is to be.', 'It’ll do her good.', 'You’re\\nagreeable?', 'Thank’ee.', 'What’s that!’\\n\\nIt was a loud cry from the Carrier’s wife: a loud, sharp, sudden cry,\\nthat made the room ring, like a glass vessel.', 'She had risen from her\\nseat, and stood like one transfixed by terror and surprise.', 'The Stranger\\nhad advanced towards the fire to warm himself, and stood within a short\\nstride of her chair.', 'But quite still.', '‘Dot!’ cried the Carrier.', '‘Mary!', 'Darling!', 'What’s the matter?’\\n\\nThey were all about her in a moment.', 'Caleb, who had been dozing on the\\ncake-box, in the first imperfect recovery of his suspended presence of\\nmind, seized Miss Slowboy by the hair of her head, but immediately\\napologised.', '‘Mary!’ exclaimed the Carrier, supporting her in his arms.', '‘Are you ill!', 'What is it?', 'Tell me, dear!’\\n\\nShe only answered by beating her hands together, and falling into a wild\\nfit of laughter.', 'Then, sinking from his grasp upon the ground, she\\ncovered her face with her apron, and wept bitterly.', 'And then she laughed\\nagain, and then she cried again, and then she said how cold it was, and\\nsuffered him to lead her to the fire, where she sat down as before.', 'The\\nold man standing, as before, quite still.', '‘I’m better, John,’ she said.', '‘I’m quite well now—I—’\\n\\n‘John!’  But John was on the other side of her.', 'Why turn her face\\ntowards the strange old gentleman, as if addressing him!', 'Was her brain\\nwandering?', '‘Only a fancy, John dear—a kind of shock—a something coming suddenly\\nbefore my eyes—I don’t know what it was.', 'It’s quite gone, quite gone.’\\n\\n‘I’m glad it’s gone,’ muttered Tackleton, turning the expressive eye all\\nround the room.', '‘I wonder where it’s gone, and what it was.', 'Humph!', 'Caleb, come here!', 'Who’s that with the grey hair?’\\n\\n‘I don’t know, sir,’ returned Caleb in a whisper.', '‘Never see him before,\\nin all my life.', 'A beautiful figure for a nut-cracker; quite a new model.', 'With a screw-jaw opening down into his waistcoat, he’d be lovely.’\\n\\n‘Not ugly enough,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Or for a firebox, either,’ observed Caleb, in deep contemplation, ‘what\\na model!', 'Unscrew his head to put the matches in; turn him heels up’ards\\nfor the light; and what a firebox for a gentleman’s mantel-shelf, just as\\nhe stands!’\\n\\n‘Not half ugly enough,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Nothing in him at all!', 'Come!', 'Bring that box!', 'All right now, I hope?’\\n\\n‘Oh quite gone!', 'Quite gone!’ said the little woman, waving him hurriedly\\naway.', '‘Good night!’\\n\\n‘Good night,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Good night, John Peerybingle!', 'Take care\\nhow you carry that box, Caleb.', 'Let it fall, and I’ll murder you!', 'Dark\\nas pitch, and weather worse than ever, eh?', 'Good night!’\\n\\nSo, with another sharp look round the room, he went out at the door;\\nfollowed by Caleb with the wedding-cake on his head.', 'The Carrier had been so much astounded by his little wife, and so busily\\nengaged in soothing and tending her, that he had scarcely been conscious\\nof the Stranger’s presence, until now, when he again stood there, their\\nonly guest.', '‘He don’t belong to them, you see,’ said John.', '‘I must give him a hint\\nto go.’\\n\\n‘I beg your pardon, friend,’ said the old gentleman, advancing to him;\\n‘the more so, as I fear your wife has not been well; but the Attendant\\nwhom my infirmity,’ he touched his ears and shook his head, ‘renders\\nalmost indispensable, not having arrived, I fear there must be some\\nmistake.', 'The bad night which made the shelter of your comfortable cart\\n(may I never have a worse!)', 'so acceptable, is still as bad as ever.', 'Would you, in your kindness, suffer me to rent a bed here?’\\n\\n‘Yes, yes,’ cried Dot.', '‘Yes!', 'Certainly!’\\n\\n‘Oh!’ said the Carrier, surprised by the rapidity of this consent.', '‘Well!', 'I don’t object; but, still I’m not quite sure that—’\\n\\n‘Hush!’ she interrupted.', '‘Dear John!’\\n\\n‘Why, he’s stone deaf,’ urged John.', '‘I know he is, but—Yes, sir, certainly.', 'Yes!', 'certainly!', 'I’ll make him\\nup a bed, directly, John.’\\n\\nAs she hurried off to do it, the flutter of her spirits, and the\\nagitation of her manner, were so strange that the Carrier stood looking\\nafter her, quite confounded.', '‘Did its mothers make it up a Beds then!’ cried Miss Slowboy to the Baby;\\n‘and did its hair grow brown and curly, when its caps was lifted off, and\\nfrighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the fires!’\\n\\nWith that unaccountable attraction of the mind to trifles, which is often\\nincidental to a state of doubt and confusion, the Carrier as he walked\\nslowly to and fro, found himself mentally repeating even these absurd\\nwords, many times.', 'So many times that he got them by heart, and was\\nstill conning them over and over, like a lesson, when Tilly, after\\nadministering as much friction to the little bald head with her hand as\\nshe thought wholesome (according to the practice of nurses), had once\\nmore tied the Baby’s cap on.', '‘And frighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the fires.', 'What\\nfrightened Dot, I wonder!’ mused the Carrier, pacing to and fro.', 'He scouted, from his heart, the insinuations of the Toy-merchant, and yet\\nthey filled him with a vague, indefinite uneasiness.', 'For, Tackleton was\\nquick and sly; and he had that painful sense, himself, of being a man of slow\\nperception, that a broken hint was always worrying to him.', 'He certainly\\nhad no intention in his mind of linking anything that Tackleton had said,\\nwith the unusual conduct of his wife, but the two subjects of reflection\\ncame into his mind together, and he could not keep them asunder.', 'The bed was soon made ready; and the visitor, declining all refreshment\\nbut a cup of tea, retired.', 'Then, Dot—quite well again, she said, quite\\nwell again—arranged the great chair in the chimney-corner for her\\nhusband; filled his pipe and gave it him; and took her usual little stool\\nbeside him on the hearth.', 'She always _would_ sit on that little stool.', 'I think she must have had a\\nkind of notion that it was a coaxing, wheedling little stool.', 'She was, out and out, the very best filler of a pipe, I should say, in\\nthe four quarters of the globe.', 'To see her put that chubby little finger\\nin the bowl, and then blow down the pipe to clear the tube, and, when she\\nhad done so, affect to think that there was really something in the tube,\\nand blow a dozen times, and hold it to her eye like a telescope, with a\\nmost provoking twist in her capital little face, as she looked down it,\\nwas quite a brilliant thing.', 'As to the tobacco, she was perfect mistress\\nof the subject; and her lighting of the pipe, with a wisp of paper, when\\nthe Carrier had it in his mouth—going so very near his nose, and yet not\\nscorching it—was Art, high Art.', 'And the Cricket and the kettle, turning up again, acknowledged it!', 'The\\nbright fire, blazing up again, acknowledged it!', 'The little Mower on the\\nclock, in his unheeded work, acknowledged it!', 'The Carrier, in his\\nsmoothing forehead and expanding face, acknowledged it, the readiest of\\nall.', 'And as he soberly and thoughtfully puffed at his old pipe, and as the\\nDutch clock ticked, and as the red fire gleamed, and as the Cricket\\nchirped; that Genius of his Hearth and Home (for such the Cricket was)\\ncame out, in fairy shape, into the room, and summoned many forms of Home\\nabout him.', 'Dots of all ages, and all sizes, filled the chamber.', 'Dots\\nwho were merry children, running on before him gathering flowers, in the\\nfields; coy Dots, half shrinking from, half yielding to, the pleading of\\nhis own rough image; newly-married Dots, alighting at the door, and\\ntaking wondering possession of the household keys; motherly little Dots,\\nattended by fictitious Slowboys, bearing babies to be christened;\\nmatronly Dots, still young and blooming, watching Dots of daughters, as\\nthey danced at rustic balls; fat Dots, encircled and beset by troops of\\nrosy grandchildren; withered Dots, who leaned on sticks, and tottered as\\nthey crept along.', 'Old Carriers too, appeared, with blind old Boxers\\nlying at their feet; and newer carts with younger drivers (‘Peerybingle\\nBrothers’ on the tilt); and sick old Carriers, tended by the gentlest\\nhands; and graves of dead and gone old Carriers, green in the churchyard.', 'And as the Cricket showed him all these things—he saw them plainly,\\nthough his eyes were fixed upon the fire—the Carrier’s heart grew light\\nand happy, and he thanked his Household Gods with all his might, and\\ncared no more for Gruff and Tackleton than you do.', '* * * * *\\n\\nBut, what was that young figure of a man, which the same Fairy Cricket\\nset so near Her stool, and which remained there, singly and alone?', 'Why\\ndid it linger still, so near her, with its arm upon the chimney-piece,\\never repeating ‘Married!', 'and not to me!’\\n\\nO Dot!', 'O failing Dot!', 'There is no place for it in all your husband’s\\nvisions; why has its shadow fallen on his hearth!', 'CHAPTER II—Chirp the Second\\n\\n\\nCaleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all alone by themselves, as\\nthe Story-books say—and my blessing, with yours to back it I hope, on the\\nStory-books, for saying anything in this workaday world!—Caleb Plummer\\nand his Blind Daughter lived all alone by themselves, in a little cracked\\nnutshell of a wooden house, which was, in truth, no better than a pimple\\non the prominent red-brick nose of Gruff and Tackleton.', 'The premises of\\nGruff and Tackleton were the great feature of the street; but you might\\nhave knocked down Caleb Plummer’s dwelling with a hammer or two, and\\ncarried off the pieces in a cart.', 'If any one had done the dwelling-house of Caleb Plummer the honour to\\nmiss it after such an inroad, it would have been, no doubt, to commend\\nits demolition as a vast improvement.', 'It stuck to the premises of Gruff\\nand Tackleton, like a barnacle to a ship’s keel, or a snail to a door, or\\na little bunch of toadstools to the stem of a tree.', 'But, it was the germ from which the full-grown trunk of Gruff and\\nTackleton had sprung; and, under its crazy roof, the Gruff before last,\\nhad, in a small way, made toys for a generation of old boys and girls,\\nwho had played with them, and found them out, and broken them, and gone\\nto sleep.', 'I have said that Caleb and his poor Blind Daughter lived here.', 'I should\\nhave said that Caleb lived here, and his poor Blind Daughter somewhere\\nelse—in an enchanted home of Caleb’s furnishing, where scarcity and\\nshabbiness were not, and trouble never entered.', 'Caleb was no sorcerer,\\nbut in the only magic art that still remains to us, the magic of devoted,\\ndeathless love, Nature had been the mistress of his study; and from her\\nteaching, all the wonder came.', 'The Blind Girl never knew that ceilings were discoloured, walls blotched\\nand bare of plaster here and there, high crevices unstopped and widening\\nevery day, beams mouldering and tending downward.', 'The Blind Girl never\\nknew that iron was rusting, wood rotting, paper peeling off; the size,\\nand shape, and true proportion of the dwelling, withering away.', 'The\\nBlind Girl never knew that ugly shapes of delf and earthenware were on\\nthe board; that sorrow and faintheartedness were in the house; that\\nCaleb’s scanty hairs were turning greyer and more grey, before her\\nsightless face.', 'The Blind Girl never knew they had a master, cold,\\nexacting, and uninterested—never knew that Tackleton was Tackleton in\\nshort; but lived in the belief of an eccentric humourist who loved to\\nhave his jest with them, and who, while he was the Guardian Angel of\\ntheir lives, disdained to hear one word of thankfulness.', 'And all was Caleb’s doing; all the doing of her simple father!', 'But he\\ntoo had a Cricket on his Hearth; and listening sadly to its music when\\nthe motherless Blind Child was very young, that Spirit had inspired him\\nwith the thought that even her great deprivation might be almost changed\\ninto a blessing, and the girl made happy by these little means.', 'For all\\nthe Cricket tribe are potent Spirits, even though the people who hold\\nconverse with them do not know it (which is frequently the case); and\\nthere are not in the unseen world, voices more gentle and more true, that\\nmay be so implicitly relied on, or that are so certain to give none but\\ntenderest counsel, as the Voices in which the Spirits of the Fireside and\\nthe Hearth address themselves to human kind.', 'Caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual working-room,\\nwhich served them for their ordinary living-room as well; and a strange\\nplace it was.', 'There were houses in it, finished and unfinished, for\\nDolls of all stations in life.', 'Suburban tenements for Dolls of moderate\\nmeans; kitchens and single apartments for Dolls of the lower classes;\\ncapital town residences for Dolls of high estate.', 'Some of these\\nestablishments were already furnished according to estimate, with a view\\nto the convenience of Dolls of limited income; others could be fitted on\\nthe most expensive scale, at a moment’s notice, from whole shelves of\\nchairs and tables, sofas, bedsteads, and upholstery.', 'The nobility and\\ngentry, and public in general, for whose accommodation these tenements\\nwere designed, lay, here and there, in baskets, staring straight up at\\nthe ceiling; but, in denoting their degrees in society, and confining\\nthem to their respective stations (which experience shows to be\\nlamentably difficult in real life), the makers of these Dolls had far\\nimproved on Nature, who is often froward and perverse; for, they, not\\nresting on such arbitrary marks as satin, cotton-print, and bits of rag,\\nhad superadded striking personal differences which allowed of no mistake.', 'Thus, the Doll-lady of distinction had wax limbs of perfect symmetry; but\\nonly she and her compeers.', 'The next grade in the social scale being made\\nof leather, and the next of coarse linen stuff.', 'As to the common-people,\\nthey had just so many matches out of tinder-boxes, for their arms and\\nlegs, and there they were—established in their sphere at once, beyond the\\npossibility of getting out of it.', 'There were various other samples of his handicraft, besides Dolls, in\\nCaleb Plummer’s room.', 'There were Noah’s Arks, in which the Birds and\\nBeasts were an uncommonly tight fit, I assure you; though they could be\\ncrammed in, anyhow, at the roof, and rattled and shaken into the smallest\\ncompass.', 'By a bold poetical licence, most of these Noah’s Arks had\\nknockers on the doors; inconsistent appendages, perhaps, as suggestive of\\nmorning callers and a Postman, yet a pleasant finish to the outside of\\nthe building.', 'There were scores of melancholy little carts, which, when\\nthe wheels went round, performed most doleful music.', 'Many small fiddles,\\ndrums, and other instruments of torture; no end of cannon, shields,\\nswords, spears, and guns.', 'There were little tumblers in red breeches,\\nincessantly swarming up high obstacles of red-tape, and coming down, head\\nfirst, on the other side; and there were innumerable old gentlemen of\\nrespectable, not to say venerable, appearance, insanely flying over\\nhorizontal pegs, inserted, for the purpose, in their own street doors.', 'There were beasts of all sorts; horses, in particular, of every breed,\\nfrom the spotted barrel on four pegs, with a small tippet for a mane, to\\nthe thoroughbred rocker on his highest mettle.', 'As it would have been\\nhard to count the dozens upon dozens of grotesque figures that were ever\\nready to commit all sorts of absurdities on the turning of a handle, so\\nit would have been no easy task to mention any human folly, vice, or\\nweakness, that had not its type, immediate or remote, in Caleb Plummer’s\\nroom.', 'And not in an exaggerated form, for very little handles will move\\nmen and women to as strange performances, as any Toy was ever made to\\nundertake.', 'In the midst of all these objects, Caleb and his daughter sat at work.', 'The Blind Girl busy as a Doll’s dressmaker; Caleb painting and glazing\\nthe four-pair front of a desirable family mansion.', 'The care imprinted in the lines of Caleb’s face, and his absorbed and\\ndreamy manner, which would have sat well on some alchemist or abstruse\\nstudent, were at first sight an odd contrast to his occupation, and the\\ntrivialities about him.', 'But, trivial things, invented and pursued for\\nbread, become very serious matters of fact; and, apart from this\\nconsideration, I am not at all prepared to say, myself, that if Caleb had\\nbeen a Lord Chamberlain, or a Member of Parliament, or a lawyer, or even\\na great speculator, he would have dealt in toys one whit less whimsical,\\nwhile I have a very great doubt whether they would have been as harmless.', '‘So you were out in the rain last night, father, in your beautiful new\\ngreat-coat,’ said Caleb’s daughter.', '‘In my beautiful new great-coat,’ answered Caleb, glancing towards a\\nclothes-line in the room, on which the sack-cloth garment previously\\ndescribed, was carefully hung up to dry.', '‘How glad I am you bought it, father!’\\n\\n‘And of such a tailor, too,’ said Caleb.', '‘Quite a fashionable tailor.', 'It’s too good for me.’\\n\\nThe Blind Girl rested from her work, and laughed with delight.', '‘Too good, father!', 'What can be too good for you?’\\n\\n‘I’m half-ashamed to wear it though,’ said Caleb, watching the effect of\\nwhat he said, upon her brightening face; ‘upon my word!', 'When I hear the\\nboys and people say behind me, “Hal-loa!', 'Here’s a swell!”  I don’t know\\nwhich way to look.', 'And when the beggar wouldn’t go away last night; and\\nwhen I said I was a very common man, said “No, your Honour!', 'Bless your\\nHonour, don’t say that!”  I was quite ashamed.', 'I really felt as if I\\nhadn’t a right to wear it.’\\n\\nHappy Blind Girl!', 'How merry she was, in her exultation!', '‘I see you, father,’ she said, clasping her hands, ‘as plainly, as if I\\nhad the eyes I never want when you are with me.', 'A blue coat—’\\n\\n‘Bright blue,’ said Caleb.', '‘Yes, yes!', 'Bright blue!’ exclaimed the girl, turning up her radiant\\nface; ‘the colour I can just remember in the blessed sky!', 'You told me it\\nwas blue before!', 'A bright blue coat—’\\n\\n‘Made loose to the figure,’ suggested Caleb.', '‘Made loose to the figure!’ cried the Blind Girl, laughing heartily; ‘and\\nin it, you, dear father, with your merry eye, your smiling face, your\\nfree step, and your dark hair—looking so young and handsome!’\\n\\n‘Halloa!', 'Halloa!’ said Caleb.', '‘I shall be vain, presently!’\\n\\n‘I think you are, already,’ cried the Blind Girl, pointing at him, in her\\nglee.', '‘I know you, father!', 'Ha, ha, ha!', 'I’ve found you out, you see!’\\n\\nHow different the picture in her mind, from Caleb, as he sat observing\\nher!', 'She had spoken of his free step.', 'She was right in that.', 'For years\\nand years, he had never once crossed that threshold at his own slow pace,\\nbut with a footfall counterfeited for her ear; and never had he, when his\\nheart was heaviest, forgotten the light tread that was to render hers so\\ncheerful and courageous!', 'Heaven knows!', 'But I think Caleb’s vague bewilderment of manner may have\\nhalf originated in his having confused himself about himself and\\neverything around him, for the love of his Blind Daughter.', 'How could the\\nlittle man be otherwise than bewildered, after labouring for so many\\nyears to destroy his own identity, and that of all the objects that had\\nany bearing on it!', '‘There we are,’ said Caleb, falling back a pace or two to form the better\\njudgment of his work; ‘as near the real thing as sixpenn’orth of\\nhalfpence is to sixpence.', 'What a pity that the whole front of the house\\nopens at once!', 'If there was only a staircase in it, now, and regular\\ndoors to the rooms to go in at!', 'But that’s the worst of my calling, I’m\\nalways deluding myself, and swindling myself.’\\n\\n‘You are speaking quite softly.', 'You are not tired, father?’\\n\\n‘Tired!’ echoed Caleb, with a great burst of animation, ‘what should tire\\nme, Bertha?', '_I_ was never tired.', 'What does it mean?’\\n\\nTo give the greater force to his words, he checked himself in an\\ninvoluntary imitation of two half-length stretching and yawning figures\\non the mantel-shelf, who were represented as in one eternal state of\\nweariness from the waist upwards; and hummed a fragment of a song.', 'It\\nwas a Bacchanalian song, something about a Sparkling Bowl.', 'He sang it\\nwith an assumption of a Devil-may-care voice, that made his face a\\nthousand times more meagre and more thoughtful than ever.', '‘What!', 'You’re singing, are you?’ said Tackleton, putting his head in at\\nthe door.', '‘Go it!', '_I_ can’t sing.’\\n\\nNobody would have suspected him of it.', 'He hadn’t what is generally\\ntermed a singing face, by any means.', '‘I can’t afford to sing,’ said Tackleton.', '‘I’m glad _you can_.', 'I hope\\nyou can afford to work too.', 'Hardly time for both, I should think?’\\n\\n‘If you could only see him, Bertha, how he’s winking at me!’ whispered\\nCaleb.', '‘Such a man to joke!', 'you’d think, if you didn’t know him, he was\\nin earnest—wouldn’t you now?’\\n\\nThe Blind Girl smiled and nodded.', '‘The bird that can sing and won’t sing, must be made to sing, they say,’\\ngrumbled Tackleton.', '‘What about the owl that can’t sing, and oughtn’t to\\nsing, and will sing; is there anything that _he_ should be made to do?’\\n\\n‘The extent to which he’s winking at this moment!’ whispered Caleb to his\\ndaughter.', '‘O, my gracious!’\\n\\n‘Always merry and light-hearted with us!’ cried the smiling Bertha.', '‘O, you’re there, are you?’ answered Tackleton.', '‘Poor Idiot!’\\n\\nHe really did believe she was an Idiot; and he founded the belief, I\\ncan’t say whether consciously or not, upon her being fond of him.', '‘Well!', 'and being there,—how are you?’ said Tackleton, in his grudging\\nway.', '‘Oh!', 'well; quite well.', 'And as happy as even you can wish me to be.', 'As\\nhappy as you would make the whole world, if you could!’\\n\\n‘Poor Idiot!’ muttered Tackleton.', '‘No gleam of reason.', 'Not a gleam!’\\n\\nThe Blind Girl took his hand and kissed it; held it for a moment in her\\nown two hands; and laid her cheek against it tenderly, before releasing\\nit.', 'There was such unspeakable affection and such fervent gratitude in\\nthe act, that Tackleton himself was moved to say, in a milder growl than\\nusual:\\n\\n‘What’s the matter now?’\\n\\n‘I stood it close beside my pillow when I went to sleep last night, and\\nremembered it in my dreams.', 'And when the day broke, and the glorious red\\nsun—the _red_ sun, father?’\\n\\n‘Red in the mornings and the evenings, Bertha,’ said poor Caleb, with a\\nwoeful glance at his employer.', '‘When it rose, and the bright light I almost fear to strike myself\\nagainst in walking, came into the room, I turned the little tree towards\\nit, and blessed Heaven for making things so precious, and blessed you for\\nsending them to cheer me!’\\n\\n‘Bedlam broke loose!’ said Tackleton under his breath.', '‘We shall arrive\\nat the strait-waistcoat and mufflers soon.', 'We’re getting on!’\\n\\nCaleb, with his hands hooked loosely in each other, stared vacantly\\nbefore him while his daughter spoke, as if he really were uncertain (I\\nbelieve he was) whether Tackleton had done anything to deserve her\\nthanks, or not.', 'If he could have been a perfectly free agent, at that\\nmoment, required, on pain of death, to kick the Toy-merchant, or fall at\\nhis feet, according to his merits, I believe it would have been an even\\nchance which course he would have taken.', 'Yet, Caleb knew that with his\\nown hands he had brought the little rose-tree home for her, so carefully,\\nand that with his own lips he had forged the innocent deception which\\nshould help to keep her from suspecting how much, how very much, he every\\nday, denied himself, that she might be the happier.', '‘Bertha!’ said Tackleton, assuming, for the nonce, a little cordiality.', '‘Come here.’\\n\\n‘Oh!', 'I can come straight to you!', 'You needn’t guide me!’ she rejoined.', '‘Shall I tell you a secret, Bertha?’\\n\\n‘If you will!’ she answered, eagerly.', 'How bright the darkened face!', 'How adorned with light, the listening\\nhead!', '‘This is the day on which little what’s-her-name, the spoilt child,\\nPeerybingle’s wife, pays her regular visit to you—makes her fantastic\\nPic-Nic here; an’t it?’ said Tackleton, with a strong expression of\\ndistaste for the whole concern.', '‘Yes,’ replied Bertha.', '‘This is the day.’\\n\\n‘I thought so,’ said Tackleton.', '‘I should like to join the party.’\\n\\n‘Do you hear that, father!’ cried the Blind Girl in an ecstasy.', '‘Yes, yes, I hear it,’ murmured Caleb, with the fixed look of a\\nsleep-walker; ‘but I don’t believe it.', 'It’s one of my lies, I’ve no\\ndoubt.’\\n\\n‘You see I—I want to bring the Peerybingles a little more into company\\nwith May Fielding,’ said Tackleton.', '‘I am going to be married to May.’\\n\\n‘Married!’ cried the Blind Girl, starting from him.', '‘She’s such a con-founded Idiot,’ muttered Tackleton, ‘that I was afraid\\nshe’d never comprehend me.', 'Ah, Bertha!', 'Married!', 'Church, parson, clerk,\\nbeadle, glass-coach, bells, breakfast, bride-cake, favours, marrow-bones,\\ncleavers, and all the rest of the tom-foolery.', 'A wedding, you know; a\\nwedding.', 'Don’t you know what a wedding is?’\\n\\n‘I know,’ replied the Blind Girl, in a gentle tone.', '‘I understand!’\\n\\n‘Do you?’ muttered Tackleton.', '‘It’s more than I expected.', 'Well!', 'On\\nthat account I want to join the party, and to bring May and her mother.', 'I’ll send in a little something or other, before the afternoon.', 'A cold\\nleg of mutton, or some comfortable trifle of that sort.', 'You’ll expect\\nme?’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ she answered.', 'She had drooped her head, and turned away; and so stood, with her hands\\ncrossed, musing.', '‘I don’t think you will,’ muttered Tackleton, looking at her; ‘for you\\nseem to have forgotten all about it, already.', 'Caleb!’\\n\\n‘I may venture to say I’m here, I suppose,’ thought Caleb.', '‘Sir!’\\n\\n‘Take care she don’t forget what I’ve been saying to her.’\\n\\n‘_She_ never forgets,’ returned Caleb.', '‘It’s one of the few things she\\nan’t clever in.’\\n\\n‘Every man thinks his own geese swans,’ observed the Toy-merchant, with a\\nshrug.', '‘Poor devil!’\\n\\nHaving delivered himself of which remark, with infinite contempt, old\\nGruff and Tackleton withdrew.', 'Bertha remained where he had left her, lost in meditation.', 'The gaiety\\nhad vanished from her downcast face, and it was very sad.', 'Three or four\\ntimes she shook her head, as if bewailing some remembrance or some loss;\\nbut her sorrowful reflections found no vent in words.', 'It was not until Caleb had been occupied, some time, in yoking a team of\\nhorses to a waggon by the summary process of nailing the harness to the\\nvital parts of their bodies, that she drew near to his working-stool, and\\nsitting down beside him, said:\\n\\n‘Father, I am lonely in the dark.', 'I want my eyes, my patient, willing\\neyes.’\\n\\n‘Here they are,’ said Caleb.', '‘Always ready.', 'They are more yours than\\nmine, Bertha, any hour in the four-and-twenty.', 'What shall your eyes do\\nfor you, dear?’\\n\\n‘Look round the room, father.’\\n\\n‘All right,’ said Caleb.', '‘No sooner said than done, Bertha.’\\n\\n‘Tell me about it.’\\n\\n‘It’s much the same as usual,’ said Caleb.', '‘Homely, but very snug.', 'The\\ngay colours on the walls; the bright flowers on the plates and dishes;\\nthe shining wood, where there are beams or panels; the general\\ncheerfulness and neatness of the building; make it very pretty.’\\n\\nCheerful and neat it was wherever Bertha’s hands could busy themselves.', 'But nowhere else, were cheerfulness and neatness possible, in the old\\ncrazy shed which Caleb’s fancy so transformed.', '‘You have your working dress on, and are not so gallant as when you wear\\nthe handsome coat?’ said Bertha, touching him.', '‘Not quite so gallant,’ answered Caleb.', '‘Pretty brisk though.’\\n\\n‘Father,’ said the Blind Girl, drawing close to his side, and stealing\\none arm round his neck, ‘tell me something about May.', 'She is very fair?’\\n\\n‘She is indeed,’ said Caleb.', 'And she was indeed.', 'It was quite a rare\\nthing to Caleb, not to have to draw on his invention.', '‘Her hair is dark,’ said Bertha, pensively, ‘darker than mine.', 'Her voice\\nis sweet and musical, I know.', 'I have often loved to hear it.', 'Her\\nshape—’\\n\\n‘There’s not a Doll’s in all the room to equal it,’ said Caleb.', '‘And her\\neyes!—’\\n\\nHe stopped; for Bertha had drawn closer round his neck, and from the arm\\nthat clung about him, came a warning pressure which he understood too\\nwell.', 'He coughed a moment, hammered for a moment, and then fell back upon the\\nsong about the sparkling bowl; his infallible resource in all such\\ndifficulties.', '‘Our friend, father, our benefactor.', 'I am never tired, you know, of\\nhearing about him.—Now, was I ever?’ she said, hastily.', '‘Of course not,’ answered Caleb, ‘and with reason.’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'With how much reason!’ cried the Blind Girl.', 'With such fervency,\\nthat Caleb, though his motives were so pure, could not endure to meet her\\nface; but dropped his eyes, as if she could have read in them his\\ninnocent deceit.', '‘Then, tell me again about him, dear father,’ said Bertha.', '‘Many times\\nagain!', 'His face is benevolent, kind, and tender.', 'Honest and true, I am\\nsure it is.', 'The manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a show\\nof roughness and unwillingness, beats in its every look and glance.’\\n\\n‘And makes it noble!’ added Caleb, in his quiet desperation.', '‘And makes it noble!’ cried the Blind Girl.', '‘He is older than May,\\nfather.’\\n\\n‘Ye-es,’ said Caleb, reluctantly.', '‘He’s a little older than May.', 'But\\nthat don’t signify.’\\n\\n‘Oh father, yes!', 'To be his patient companion in infirmity and age; to be\\nhis gentle nurse in sickness, and his constant friend in suffering and\\nsorrow; to know no weariness in working for his sake; to watch him, tend\\nhim, sit beside his bed and talk to him awake, and pray for him asleep;\\nwhat privileges these would be!', 'What opportunities for proving all her\\ntruth and devotion to him!', 'Would she do all this, dear father?', '‘No doubt of it,’ said Caleb.', '‘I love her, father; I can love her from my soul!’ exclaimed the Blind\\nGirl.', 'And saying so, she laid her poor blind face on Caleb’s shoulder,\\nand so wept and wept, that he was almost sorry to have brought that\\ntearful happiness upon her.', 'In the mean time, there had been a pretty sharp commotion at John\\nPeerybingle’s, for little Mrs. Peerybingle naturally couldn’t think of\\ngoing anywhere without the Baby; and to get the Baby under weigh took\\ntime.', 'Not that there was much of the Baby, speaking of it as a thing of\\nweight and measure, but there was a vast deal to do about and about it,\\nand it all had to be done by easy stages.', 'For instance, when the Baby\\nwas got, by hook and by crook, to a certain point of dressing, and you\\nmight have rationally supposed that another touch or two would finish him\\noff, and turn him out a tip-top Baby challenging the world, he was\\nunexpectedly extinguished in a flannel cap, and hustled off to bed; where\\nhe simmered (so to speak) between two blankets for the best part of an\\nhour.', 'From this state of inaction he was then recalled, shining very\\nmuch and roaring violently, to partake of—well?', 'I would rather say, if\\nyou’ll permit me to speak generally—of a slight repast.', 'After which, he\\nwent to sleep again.', 'Mrs. Peerybingle took advantage of this interval,\\nto make herself as smart in a small way as ever you saw anybody in all\\nyour life; and, during the same short truce, Miss Slowboy insinuated\\nherself into a spencer of a fashion so surprising and ingenious, that it\\nhad no connection with herself, or anything else in the universe, but was\\na shrunken, dog’s-eared, independent fact, pursuing its lonely course\\nwithout the least regard to anybody.', 'By this time, the Baby, being all\\nalive again, was invested, by the united efforts of Mrs. Peerybingle and\\nMiss Slowboy, with a cream-coloured mantle for its body, and a sort of\\nnankeen raised-pie for its head; and so in course of time they all three\\ngot down to the door, where the old horse had already taken more than the\\nfull value of his day’s toll out of the Turnpike Trust, by tearing up the\\nroad with his impatient autographs; and whence Boxer might be dimly seen\\nin the remote perspective, standing looking back, and tempting him to\\ncome on without orders.', 'As to a chair, or anything of that kind for helping Mrs. Peerybingle into\\nthe cart, you know very little of John, if you think _that_ was\\nnecessary.', 'Before you could have seen him lift her from the ground,\\nthere she was in her place, fresh and rosy, saying, ‘John!', 'How _can_\\nyou!', 'Think of Tilly!’\\n\\nIf I might be allowed to mention a young lady’s legs, on any terms, I\\nwould observe of Miss Slowboy’s that there was a fatality about them\\nwhich rendered them singularly liable to be grazed; and that she never\\neffected the smallest ascent or descent, without recording the\\ncircumstance upon them with a notch, as Robinson Crusoe marked the days\\nupon his wooden calendar.', 'But as this might be considered ungenteel,\\nI’ll think of it.', '‘John?', 'You’ve got the Basket with the Veal and Ham-Pie and things, and\\nthe bottles of Beer?’ said Dot.', '‘If you haven’t, you must turn round\\nagain, this very minute.’\\n\\n‘You’re a nice little article,’ returned the Carrier, ‘to be talking\\nabout turning round, after keeping me a full quarter of an hour behind my\\ntime.’\\n\\n‘I am sorry for it, John,’ said Dot in a great bustle, ‘but I really\\ncould not think of going to Bertha’s—I would not do it, John, on any\\naccount—without the Veal and Ham-Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer.', 'Way!’\\n\\nThis monosyllable was addressed to the horse, who didn’t mind it at all.', '‘Oh _do_ way, John!’ said Mrs. Peerybingle.', '‘Please!’\\n\\n‘It’ll be time enough to do that,’ returned John, ‘when I begin to leave\\nthings behind me.', 'The basket’s here, safe enough.’\\n\\n‘What a hard-hearted monster you must be, John, not to have said so, at\\nonce, and save me such a turn!', 'I declared I wouldn’t go to Bertha’s\\nwithout the Veal and Ham-Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer, for any\\nmoney.', 'Regularly once a fortnight ever since we have been married, John,\\nhave we made our little Pic-Nic there.', 'If anything was to go wrong with\\nit, I should almost think we were never to be lucky again.’\\n\\n‘It was a kind thought in the first instance,’ said the Carrier: ‘and I\\nhonour you for it, little woman.’\\n\\n‘My dear John,’ replied Dot, turning very red, ‘don’t talk about\\nhonouring _me_.', 'Good Gracious!’\\n\\n‘By the bye—’ observed the Carrier.', '‘That old gentleman—’\\n\\nAgain so visibly, and instantly embarrassed!', '‘He’s an odd fish,’ said the Carrier, looking straight along the road\\nbefore them.', '‘I can’t make him out.', 'I don’t believe there’s any harm in\\nhim.’\\n\\n‘None at all.', 'I’m—I’m sure there’s none at all.’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ said the Carrier, with his eyes attracted to her face by the great\\nearnestness of her manner.', '‘I am glad you feel so certain of it, because\\nit’s a confirmation to me.', 'It’s curious that he should have taken it\\ninto his head to ask leave to go on lodging with us; an’t it?', 'Things\\ncome about so strangely.’\\n\\n‘So very strangely,’ she rejoined in a low voice, scarcely audible.', '‘However, he’s a good-natured old gentleman,’ said John, ‘and pays as a\\ngentleman, and I think his word is to be relied upon, like a gentleman’s.', 'I had quite a long talk with him this morning: he can hear me better\\nalready, he says, as he gets more used to my voice.', 'He told me a great\\ndeal about himself, and I told him a great deal about myself, and a rare\\nlot of questions he asked me.', 'I gave him information about my having two\\nbeats, you know, in my business; one day to the right from our house and\\nback again; another day to the left from our house and back again (for\\nhe’s a stranger and don’t know the names of places about here); and he\\nseemed quite pleased.', '“Why, then I shall be returning home to-night your\\nway,” he says, “when I thought you’d be coming in an exactly opposite\\ndirection.', 'That’s capital!', 'I may trouble you for another lift perhaps,\\nbut I’ll engage not to fall so sound asleep again.”  He _was_ sound\\nasleep, sure-ly!—Dot!', 'what are you thinking of?’\\n\\n‘Thinking of, John?', 'I—I was listening to you.’\\n\\n‘O!', 'That’s all right!’ said the honest Carrier.', '‘I was afraid, from the\\nlook of your face, that I had gone rambling on so long, as to set you\\nthinking about something else.', 'I was very near it, I’ll be bound.’\\n\\nDot making no reply, they jogged on, for some little time, in silence.', 'But, it was not easy to remain silent very long in John Peerybingle’s\\ncart, for everybody on the road had something to say.', 'Though it might\\nonly be ‘How are you!’ and indeed it was very often nothing else, still,\\nto give that back again in the right spirit of cordiality, required, not\\nmerely a nod and a smile, but as wholesome an action of the lungs withal,\\nas a long-winded Parliamentary speech.', 'Sometimes, passengers on foot, or\\nhorseback, plodded on a little way beside the cart, for the express\\npurpose of having a chat; and then there was a great deal to be said, on\\nboth sides.', 'Then, Boxer gave occasion to more good-natured recognitions of, and by,\\nthe Carrier, than half-a-dozen Christians could have done!', 'Everybody\\nknew him, all along the road—especially the fowls and pigs, who when they\\nsaw him approaching, with his body all on one side, and his ears pricked\\nup inquisitively, and that knob of a tail making the most of itself in\\nthe air, immediately withdrew into remote back settlements, without\\nwaiting for the honour of a nearer acquaintance.', 'He had business\\neverywhere; going down all the turnings, looking into all the wells,\\nbolting in and out of all the cottages, dashing into the midst of all the\\nDame-Schools, fluttering all the pigeons, magnifying the tails of all the\\ncats, and trotting into the public-houses like a regular customer.', 'Wherever he went, somebody or other might have been heard to cry,\\n‘Halloa!', 'Here’s Boxer!’ and out came that somebody forthwith,\\naccompanied by at least two or three other somebodies, to give John\\nPeerybingle and his pretty wife, Good Day.', 'The packages and parcels for the errand cart, were numerous; and there\\nwere many stoppages to take them in and give them out, which were not by\\nany means the worst parts of the journey.', 'Some people were so full of\\nexpectation about their parcels, and other people were so full of wonder\\nabout their parcels, and other people were so full of inexhaustible\\ndirections about their parcels, and John had such a lively interest in\\nall the parcels, that it was as good as a play.', 'Likewise, there were\\narticles to carry, which required to be considered and discussed, and in\\nreference to the adjustment and disposition of which, councils had to be\\nholden by the Carrier and the senders: at which Boxer usually assisted,\\nin short fits of the closest attention, and long fits of tearing round\\nand round the assembled sages and barking himself hoarse.', 'Of all these\\nlittle incidents, Dot was the amused and open-eyed spectatress from her\\nchair in the cart; and as she sat there, looking on—a charming little\\nportrait framed to admiration by the tilt—there was no lack of nudgings\\nand glancings and whisperings and envyings among the younger men.', 'And\\nthis delighted John the Carrier, beyond measure; for he was proud to have\\nhis little wife admired, knowing that she didn’t mind it—that, if\\nanything, she rather liked it perhaps.', 'The trip was a little foggy, to be sure, in the January weather; and was\\nraw and cold.', 'But who cared for such trifles?', 'Not Dot, decidedly.', 'Not\\nTilly Slowboy, for she deemed sitting in a cart, on any terms, to be the\\nhighest point of human joys; the crowning circumstance of earthly hopes.', 'Not the Baby, I’ll be sworn; for it’s not in Baby nature to be warmer or\\nmore sound asleep, though its capacity is great in both respects, than\\nthat blessed young Peerybingle was, all the way.', 'You couldn’t see very far in the fog, of course; but you could see a\\ngreat deal!', 'It’s astonishing how much you may see, in a thicker fog than\\nthat, if you will only take the trouble to look for it.', 'Why, even to sit\\nwatching for the Fairy-rings in the fields, and for the patches of\\nhoar-frost still lingering in the shade, near hedges and by trees, was a\\npleasant occupation: to make no mention of the unexpected shapes in which\\nthe trees themselves came starting out of the mist, and glided into it\\nagain.', 'The hedges were tangled and bare, and waved a multitude of\\nblighted garlands in the wind; but there was no discouragement in this.', 'It was agreeable to contemplate; for it made the fireside warmer in\\npossession, and the summer greener in expectancy.', 'The river looked\\nchilly; but it was in motion, and moving at a good pace—which was a great\\npoint.', 'The canal was rather slow and torpid; that must be admitted.', 'Never mind.', 'It would freeze the sooner when the frost set fairly in, and\\nthen there would be skating, and sliding; and the heavy old barges,\\nfrozen up somewhere near a wharf, would smoke their rusty iron chimney\\npipes all day, and have a lazy time of it.', 'In one place, there was a great mound of weeds or stubble burning; and\\nthey watched the fire, so white in the daytime, flaring through the fog,\\nwith only here and there a dash of red in it, until, in consequence, as\\nshe observed, of the smoke ‘getting up her nose,’ Miss Slowboy choked—she\\ncould do anything of that sort, on the smallest provocation—and woke the\\nBaby, who wouldn’t go to sleep again.', 'But, Boxer, who was in advance\\nsome quarter of a mile or so, had already passed the outposts of the\\ntown, and gained the corner of the street where Caleb and his daughter\\nlived; and long before they had reached the door, he and the Blind Girl\\nwere on the pavement waiting to receive them.', 'Boxer, by the way, made certain delicate distinctions of his own, in his\\ncommunication with Bertha, which persuade me fully that he knew her to be\\nblind.', 'He never sought to attract her attention by looking at her, as he\\noften did with other people, but touched her invariably.', 'What experience\\nhe could ever have had of blind people or blind dogs, I don’t know.', 'He\\nhad never lived with a blind master; nor had Mr. Boxer the elder, nor\\nMrs. Boxer, nor any of his respectable family on either side, ever been\\nvisited with blindness, that I am aware of.', 'He may have found it out for\\nhimself, perhaps, but he had got hold of it somehow; and therefore he had\\nhold of Bertha too, by the skirt, and kept hold, until Mrs. Peerybingle\\nand the Baby, and Miss Slowboy, and the basket, were all got safely\\nwithin doors.', 'May Fielding was already come; and so was her mother—a little querulous\\nchip of an old lady with a peevish face, who, in right of having\\npreserved a waist like a bedpost, was supposed to be a most transcendent\\nfigure; and who, in consequence of having once been better off, or of\\nlabouring under an impression that she might have been, if something had\\nhappened which never did happen, and seemed to have never been\\nparticularly likely to come to pass—but it’s all the same—was very\\ngenteel and patronising indeed.', 'Gruff and Tackleton was also there,\\ndoing the agreeable, with the evident sensation of being as perfectly at\\nhome, and as unquestionably in his own element, as a fresh young salmon\\non the top of the Great Pyramid.', '‘May!', 'My dear old friend!’ cried Dot, running up to meet her.', '‘What a\\nhappiness to see you.’\\n\\nHer old friend was, to the full, as hearty and as glad as she; and it\\nreally was, if you’ll believe me, quite a pleasant sight to see them\\nembrace.', 'Tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question.', 'May was very\\npretty.', 'You know sometimes, when you are used to a pretty face, how, when it\\ncomes into contact and comparison with another pretty face, it seems for\\nthe moment to be homely and faded, and hardly to deserve the high opinion\\nyou have had of it.', 'Now, this was not at all the case, either with Dot\\nor May; for May’s face set off Dot’s, and Dot’s face set off May’s, so\\nnaturally and agreeably, that, as John Peerybingle was very near saying\\nwhen he came into the room, they ought to have been born sisters—which\\nwas the only improvement you could have suggested.', 'Tackleton had brought his leg of mutton, and, wonderful to relate, a tart\\nbesides—but we don’t mind a little dissipation when our brides are in the\\ncase; we don’t get married every day—and in addition to these dainties,\\nthere were the Veal and Ham-Pie, and ‘things,’ as Mrs. Peerybingle called\\nthem; which were chiefly nuts and oranges, and cakes, and such small\\ndeer.', 'When the repast was set forth on the board, flanked by Caleb’s\\ncontribution, which was a great wooden bowl of smoking potatoes (he was\\nprohibited, by solemn compact, from producing any other viands),\\nTackleton led his intended mother-in-law to the post of honour.', 'For the\\nbetter gracing of this place at the high festival, the majestic old soul\\nhad adorned herself with a cap, calculated to inspire the thoughtless\\nwith sentiments of awe.', 'She also wore her gloves.', 'But let us be\\ngenteel, or die!', 'Caleb sat next his daughter; Dot and her old schoolfellow were side by\\nside; the good Carrier took care of the bottom of the table.', 'Miss\\nSlowboy was isolated, for the time being, from every article of furniture\\nbut the chair she sat on, that she might have nothing else to knock the\\nBaby’s head against.', 'As Tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys, they stared at her and\\nat the company.', 'The venerable old gentlemen at the street doors (who\\nwere all in full action) showed especial interest in the party, pausing\\noccasionally before leaping, as if they were listening to the\\nconversation, and then plunging wildly over and over, a great many times,\\nwithout halting for breath—as in a frantic state of delight with the\\nwhole proceedings.', 'Certainly, if these old gentlemen were inclined to have a fiendish joy in\\nthe contemplation of Tackleton’s discomfiture, they had good reason to be\\nsatisfied.', 'Tackleton couldn’t get on at all; and the more cheerful his\\nintended bride became in Dot’s society, the less he liked it, though he\\nhad brought them together for that purpose.', 'For he was a regular dog in\\nthe manger, was Tackleton; and when they laughed and he couldn’t, he took\\nit into his head, immediately, that they must be laughing at him.', '‘Ah, May!’ said Dot.', '‘Dear dear, what changes!', 'To talk of those merry\\nschool-days makes one young again.’\\n\\n‘Why, you an’t particularly old, at any time; are you?’ said Tackleton.', '‘Look at my sober plodding husband there,’ returned Dot.', '‘He adds twenty\\nyears to my age at least.', 'Don’t you, John?’\\n\\n‘Forty,’ John replied.', '‘How many _you_’ll add to May’s, I am sure I don’t know,’ said Dot,\\nlaughing.', '‘But she can’t be much less than a hundred years of age on her\\nnext birthday.’\\n\\n‘Ha ha!’ laughed Tackleton.', 'Hollow as a drum, that laugh though.', 'And he\\nlooked as if he could have twisted Dot’s neck, comfortably.', '‘Dear dear!’ said Dot.', '‘Only to remember how we used to talk, at school,\\nabout the husbands we would choose.', 'I don’t know how young, and how\\nhandsome, and how gay, and how lively, mine was not to be!', 'And as to\\nMay’s!—Ah dear!', 'I don’t know whether to laugh or cry, when I think what\\nsilly girls we were.’\\n\\nMay seemed to know which to do; for the colour flushed into her face, and\\ntears stood in her eyes.', '‘Even the very persons themselves—real live young men—were fixed on\\nsometimes,’ said Dot.', '‘We little thought how things would come about.', 'I\\nnever fixed on John I’m sure; I never so much as thought of him.', 'And if\\nI had told you, you were ever to be married to Mr. Tackleton, why you’d\\nhave slapped me.', 'Wouldn’t you, May?’\\n\\nThough May didn’t say yes, she certainly didn’t say no, or express no, by\\nany means.', 'Tackleton laughed—quite shouted, he laughed so loud.', 'John Peerybingle\\nlaughed too, in his ordinary good-natured and contented manner; but his\\nwas a mere whisper of a laugh, to Tackleton’s.', '‘You couldn’t help yourselves, for all that.', 'You couldn’t resist us, you\\nsee,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Here we are!', 'Here we are!’\\n\\n‘Where are your gay young bridegrooms now!’\\n\\n‘Some of them are dead,’ said Dot; ‘and some of them forgotten.', 'Some of\\nthem, if they could stand among us at this moment, would not believe we\\nwere the same creatures; would not believe that what they saw and heard\\nwas real, and we _could_ forget them so.', 'No!', 'they would not believe one\\nword of it!’\\n\\n‘Why, Dot!’ exclaimed the Carrier.', '‘Little woman!’\\n\\nShe had spoken with such earnestness and fire, that she stood in need of\\nsome recalling to herself, without doubt.', 'Her husband’s check was very\\ngentle, for he merely interfered, as he supposed, to shield old\\nTackleton; but it proved effectual, for she stopped, and said no more.', 'There was an uncommon agitation, even in her silence, which the wary\\nTackleton, who had brought his half-shut eye to bear upon her, noted\\nclosely, and remembered to some purpose too.', 'May uttered no word, good or bad, but sat quite still, with her eyes cast\\ndown, and made no sign of interest in what had passed.', 'The good lady her\\nmother now interposed, observing, in the first instance, that girls were\\ngirls, and byegones byegones, and that so long as young people were young\\nand thoughtless, they would probably conduct themselves like young and\\nthoughtless persons: with two or three other positions of a no less sound\\nand incontrovertible character.', 'She then remarked, in a devout spirit,\\nthat she thanked Heaven she had always found in her daughter May, a\\ndutiful and obedient child; for which she took no credit to herself,\\nthough she had every reason to believe it was entirely owing to herself.', 'With regard to Mr. Tackleton she said, That he was in a moral point of\\nview an undeniable individual, and That he was in an eligible point of\\nview a son-in-law to be desired, no one in their senses could doubt.', '(She was very emphatic here.)', 'With regard to the family into which he\\nwas so soon about, after some solicitation, to be admitted, she believed\\nMr. Tackleton knew that, although reduced in purse, it had some\\npretensions to gentility; and if certain circumstances, not wholly\\nunconnected, she would go so far as to say, with the Indigo Trade, but to\\nwhich she would not more particularly refer, had happened differently, it\\nmight perhaps have been in possession of wealth.', 'She then remarked that\\nshe would not allude to the past, and would not mention that her daughter\\nhad for some time rejected the suit of Mr. Tackleton; and that she would\\nnot say a great many other things which she did say, at great length.', 'Finally, she delivered it as the general result of her observation and\\nexperience, that those marriages in which there was least of what was\\nromantically and sillily called love, were always the happiest; and that\\nshe anticipated the greatest possible amount of bliss—not rapturous\\nbliss; but the solid, steady-going article—from the approaching nuptials.', 'She concluded by informing the company that to-morrow was the day she had\\nlived for, expressly; and that when it was over, she would desire nothing\\nbetter than to be packed up and disposed of, in any genteel place of\\nburial.', 'As these remarks were quite unanswerable—which is the happy property of\\nall remarks that are sufficiently wide of the purpose—they changed the\\ncurrent of the conversation, and diverted the general attention to the\\nVeal and Ham-Pie, the cold mutton, the potatoes, and the tart.', 'In order\\nthat the bottled beer might not be slighted, John Peerybingle proposed\\nTo-morrow: the Wedding-Day; and called upon them to drink a bumper to it,\\nbefore he proceeded on his journey.', 'For you ought to know that he only rested there, and gave the old horse a\\nbait.', 'He had to go some four or five miles farther on; and when he\\nreturned in the evening, he called for Dot, and took another rest on his\\nway home.', 'This was the order of the day on all the Pic-Nic occasions,\\nhad been, ever since their institution.', 'There were two persons present, besides the bride and bridegroom elect,\\nwho did but indifferent honour to the toast.', 'One of these was Dot, too\\nflushed and discomposed to adapt herself to any small occurrence of the\\nmoment; the other, Bertha, who rose up hurriedly, before the rest, and\\nleft the table.', '‘Good bye!’ said stout John Peerybingle, pulling on his dreadnought coat.', '‘I shall be back at the old time.', 'Good bye all!’\\n\\n‘Good bye, John,’ returned Caleb.', 'He seemed to say it by rote, and to wave his hand in the same unconscious\\nmanner; for he stood observing Bertha with an anxious wondering face,\\nthat never altered its expression.', '‘Good bye, young shaver!’ said the jolly Carrier, bending down to kiss\\nthe child; which Tilly Slowboy, now intent upon her knife and fork, had\\ndeposited asleep (and strange to say, without damage) in a little cot of\\nBertha’s furnishing; ‘good bye!', 'Time will come, I suppose, when _you’ll_\\nturn out into the cold, my little friend, and leave your old father to\\nenjoy his pipe and his rheumatics in the chimney-corner; eh?', 'Where’s\\nDot?’\\n\\n‘I’m here, John!’ she said, starting.', '‘Come, come!’ returned the Carrier, clapping his sounding hands.', '‘Where’s the pipe?’\\n\\n‘I quite forgot the pipe, John.’\\n\\nForgot the pipe!', 'Was such a wonder ever heard of!', 'She!', 'Forgot the\\npipe!', '‘I’ll—I’ll fill it directly.', 'It’s soon done.’\\n\\nBut it was not so soon done, either.', 'It lay in the usual place—the\\nCarrier’s dreadnought pocket—with the little pouch, her own work, from\\nwhich she was used to fill it, but her hand shook so, that she entangled\\nit (and yet her hand was small enough to have come out easily, I am\\nsure), and bungled terribly.', 'The filling of the pipe and lighting it,\\nthose little offices in which I have commended her discretion, were\\nvilely done, from first to last.', 'During the whole process, Tackleton\\nstood looking on maliciously with the half-closed eye; which, whenever it\\nmet hers—or caught it, for it can hardly be said to have ever met another\\neye: rather being a kind of trap to snatch it up—augmented her confusion\\nin a most remarkable degree.', '‘Why, what a clumsy Dot you are, this afternoon!’ said John.', '‘I could\\nhave done it better myself, I verily believe!’\\n\\nWith these good-natured words, he strode away, and presently was heard,\\nin company with Boxer, and the old horse, and the cart, making lively\\nmusic down the road.', 'What time the dreamy Caleb still stood, watching\\nhis blind daughter, with the same expression on his face.', '‘Bertha!’ said Caleb, softly.', '‘What has happened?', 'How changed you are,\\nmy darling, in a few hours—since this morning.', '_You_ silent and dull all\\nday!', 'What is it?', 'Tell me!’\\n\\n‘Oh father, father!’ cried the Blind Girl, bursting into tears.', '‘Oh my\\nhard, hard fate!’\\n\\nCaleb drew his hand across his eyes before he answered her.', '‘But think how cheerful and how happy you have been, Bertha!', 'How good,\\nand how much loved, by many people.’\\n\\n‘That strikes me to the heart, dear father!', 'Always so mindful of me!', 'Always so kind to me!’\\n\\nCaleb was very much perplexed to understand her.', '‘To be—to be blind, Bertha, my poor dear,’ he faltered, ‘is a great\\naffliction; but—’\\n\\n‘I have never felt it!’ cried the Blind Girl.', '‘I have never felt it, in\\nits fulness.', 'Never!', 'I have sometimes wished that I could see you, or\\ncould see him—only once, dear father, only for one little minute—that I\\nmight know what it is I treasure up,’ she laid her hands upon her breast,\\n‘and hold here!', 'That I might be sure and have it right!', 'And sometimes\\n(but then I was a child) I have wept in my prayers at night, to think\\nthat when your images ascended from my heart to Heaven, they might not be\\nthe true resemblance of yourselves.', 'But I have never had these feelings\\nlong.', 'They have passed away and left me tranquil and contented.’\\n\\n‘And they will again,’ said Caleb.', '‘But, father!', 'Oh my good, gentle father, bear with me, if I am wicked!’\\nsaid the Blind Girl.', '‘This is not the sorrow that so weighs me down!’\\n\\nHer father could not choose but let his moist eyes overflow; she was so\\nearnest and pathetic, but he did not understand her, yet.', '‘Bring her to me,’ said Bertha.', '‘I cannot hold it closed and shut within\\nmyself.', 'Bring her to me, father!’\\n\\nShe knew he hesitated, and said, ‘May.', 'Bring May!’\\n\\nMay heard the mention of her name, and coming quietly towards her,\\ntouched her on the arm.', 'The Blind Girl turned immediately, and held her\\nby both hands.', '‘Look into my face, Dear heart, Sweet heart!’ said Bertha.', '‘Read it with\\nyour beautiful eyes, and tell me if the truth is written on it.’\\n\\n‘Dear Bertha, Yes!’\\n\\nThe Blind Girl still, upturning the blank sightless face, down which the\\ntears were coursing fast, addressed her in these words:\\n\\n‘There is not, in my soul, a wish or thought that is not for your good,\\nbright May!', 'There is not, in my soul, a grateful recollection stronger\\nthan the deep remembrance which is stored there, of the many many times\\nwhen, in the full pride of sight and beauty, you have had consideration\\nfor Blind Bertha, even when we two were children, or when Bertha was as\\nmuch a child as ever blindness can be!', 'Every blessing on your head!', 'Light upon your happy course!', 'Not the less, my dear May;’ and she drew\\ntowards her, in a closer grasp; ‘not the less, my bird, because, to-day,\\nthe knowledge that you are to be His wife has wrung my heart almost to\\nbreaking!', 'Father, May, Mary!', 'oh forgive me that it is so, for the sake\\nof all he has done to relieve the weariness of my dark life: and for the\\nsake of the belief you have in me, when I call Heaven to witness that I\\ncould not wish him married to a wife more worthy of his goodness!’\\n\\nWhile speaking, she had released May Fielding’s hands, and clasped her\\ngarments in an attitude of mingled supplication and love.', 'Sinking lower\\nand lower down, as she proceeded in her strange confession, she dropped\\nat last at the feet of her friend, and hid her blind face in the folds of\\nher dress.', '‘Great Power!’ exclaimed her father, smitten at one blow with the truth,\\n‘have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her heart at last!’\\n\\nIt was well for all of them that Dot, that beaming, useful, busy little\\nDot—for such she was, whatever faults she had, and however you may learn\\nto hate her, in good time—it was well for all of them, I say, that she\\nwas there: or where this would have ended, it were hard to tell.', 'But\\nDot, recovering her self-possession, interposed, before May could reply,\\nor Caleb say another word.', '‘Come, come, dear Bertha!', 'come away with me!', 'Give her your arm, May.', 'So!', 'How composed she is, you see, already; and how good it is of her to\\nmind us,’ said the cheery little woman, kissing her upon the forehead.', '‘Come away, dear Bertha.', 'Come!', 'and here’s her good father will come with\\nher; won’t you, Caleb?', 'To—be—sure!’\\n\\nWell, well!', 'she was a noble little Dot in such things, and it must have\\nbeen an obdurate nature that could have withstood her influence.', 'When\\nshe had got poor Caleb and his Bertha away, that they might comfort and\\nconsole each other, as she knew they only could, she presently came\\nbouncing back,—the saying is, as fresh as any daisy; I say fresher—to\\nmount guard over that bridling little piece of consequence in the cap and\\ngloves, and prevent the dear old creature from making discoveries.', '‘So bring me the precious Baby, Tilly,’ said she, drawing a chair to the\\nfire; ‘and while I have it in my lap, here’s Mrs.', 'Fielding, Tilly, will\\ntell me all about the management of Babies, and put me right in twenty\\npoints where I’m as wrong as can be.', 'Won’t you, Mrs.', 'Fielding?’\\n\\nNot even the Welsh Giant, who, according to the popular expression, was\\nso ‘slow’ as to perform a fatal surgical operation upon himself, in\\nemulation of a juggling-trick achieved by his arch-enemy at\\nbreakfast-time; not even he fell half so readily into the snare prepared\\nfor him, as the old lady did into this artful pitfall.', 'The fact of\\nTackleton having walked out; and furthermore, of two or three people\\nhaving been talking together at a distance, for two minutes, leaving her\\nto her own resources; was quite enough to have put her on her dignity,\\nand the bewailment of that mysterious convulsion in the Indigo trade, for\\nfour-and-twenty hours.', 'But this becoming deference to her experience, on\\nthe part of the young mother, was so irresistible, that after a short\\naffectation of humility, she began to enlighten her with the best grace\\nin the world; and sitting bolt upright before the wicked Dot, she did, in\\nhalf an hour, deliver more infallible domestic recipes and precepts, than\\nwould (if acted on) have utterly destroyed and done up that Young\\nPeerybingle, though he had been an Infant Samson.', 'To change the theme, Dot did a little needlework—she carried the contents\\nof a whole workbox in her pocket; however she contrived it, I don’t\\nknow—then did a little nursing; then a little more needlework; then had a\\nlittle whispering chat with May, while the old lady dozed; and so in\\nlittle bits of bustle, which was quite her manner always, found it a very\\nshort afternoon.', 'Then, as it grew dark, and as it was a solemn part of\\nthis Institution of the Pic-Nic that she should perform all Bertha’s\\nhousehold tasks, she trimmed the fire, and swept the hearth, and set the\\ntea-board out, and drew the curtain, and lighted a candle.', 'Then she\\nplayed an air or two on a rude kind of harp, which Caleb had contrived\\nfor Bertha, and played them very well; for Nature had made her delicate\\nlittle ear as choice a one for music as it would have been for jewels, if\\nshe had had any to wear.', 'By this time it was the established hour for\\nhaving tea; and Tackleton came back again, to share the meal, and spend\\nthe evening.', 'Caleb and Bertha had returned some time before, and Caleb had sat down to\\nhis afternoon’s work.', 'But he couldn’t settle to it, poor fellow, being\\nanxious and remorseful for his daughter.', 'It was touching to see him\\nsitting idle on his working-stool, regarding her so wistfully, and always\\nsaying in his face, ‘Have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break\\nher heart!’\\n\\nWhen it was night, and tea was done, and Dot had nothing more to do in\\nwashing up the cups and saucers; in a word—for I must come to it, and\\nthere is no use in putting it off—when the time drew nigh for expecting\\nthe Carrier’s return in every sound of distant wheels, her manner changed\\nagain, her colour came and went, and she was very restless.', 'Not as good\\nwives are, when listening for their husbands.', 'No, no, no.', 'It was\\nanother sort of restlessness from that.', 'Wheels heard.', 'A horse’s feet.', 'The barking of a dog.', 'The gradual\\napproach of all the sounds.', 'The scratching paw of Boxer at the door!', '‘Whose step is that!’ cried Bertha, starting up.', '‘Whose step?’ returned the Carrier, standing in the portal, with his\\nbrown face ruddy as a winter berry from the keen night air.', '‘Why, mine.’\\n\\n‘The other step,’ said Bertha.', '‘The man’s tread behind you!’\\n\\n‘She is not to be deceived,’ observed the Carrier, laughing.', '‘Come\\nalong, sir.', 'You’ll be welcome, never fear!’\\n\\nHe spoke in a loud tone; and as he spoke, the deaf old gentleman entered.', '‘He’s not so much a stranger, that you haven’t seen him once, Caleb,’\\nsaid the Carrier.', '‘You’ll give him house-room till we go?’\\n\\n‘Oh surely, John, and take it as an honour.’\\n\\n‘He’s the best company on earth, to talk secrets in,’ said John.', '‘I have\\nreasonable good lungs, but he tries ’em, I can tell you.', 'Sit down, sir.', 'All friends here, and glad to see you!’\\n\\nWhen he had imparted this assurance, in a voice that amply corroborated\\nwhat he had said about his lungs, he added in his natural tone, ‘A chair\\nin the chimney-corner, and leave to sit quite silent and look pleasantly\\nabout him, is all he cares for.', 'He’s easily pleased.’\\n\\nBertha had been listening intently.', 'She called Caleb to her side, when\\nhe had set the chair, and asked him, in a low voice, to describe their\\nvisitor.', 'When he had done so (truly now; with scrupulous fidelity), she\\nmoved, for the first time since he had come in, and sighed, and seemed to\\nhave no further interest concerning him.', 'The Carrier was in high spirits, good fellow that he was, and fonder of\\nhis little wife than ever.', '‘A clumsy Dot she was, this afternoon!’ he said, encircling her with his\\nrough arm, as she stood, removed from the rest; ‘and yet I like her\\nsomehow.', 'See yonder, Dot!’\\n\\nHe pointed to the old man.', 'She looked down.', 'I think she trembled.', '‘He’s—ha ha ha!—he’s full of admiration for you!’ said the Carrier.', '‘Talked of nothing else, the whole way here.', 'Why, he’s a brave old boy.', 'I like him for it!’\\n\\n‘I wish he had had a better subject, John,’ she said, with an uneasy\\nglance about the room.', 'At Tackleton especially.', '‘A better subject!’ cried the jovial John.', '‘There’s no such thing.', 'Come, off with the great-coat, off with the thick shawl, off with the\\nheavy wrappers!', 'and a cosy half-hour by the fire!', 'My humble service,\\nMistress.', 'A game at cribbage, you and I?', 'That’s hearty.', 'The cards and\\nboard, Dot.', 'And a glass of beer here, if there’s any left, small wife!’\\n\\nHis challenge was addressed to the old lady, who accepting it with\\ngracious readiness, they were soon engaged upon the game.', 'At first, the\\nCarrier looked about him sometimes, with a smile, or now and then called\\nDot to peep over his shoulder at his hand, and advise him on some knotty\\npoint.', 'But his adversary being a rigid disciplinarian, and subject to an\\noccasional weakness in respect of pegging more than she was entitled to,\\nrequired such vigilance on his part, as left him neither eyes nor ears to\\nspare.', 'Thus, his whole attention gradually became absorbed upon the\\ncards; and he thought of nothing else, until a hand upon his shoulder\\nrestored him to a consciousness of Tackleton.', '‘I am sorry to disturb you—but a word, directly.’\\n\\n‘I’m going to deal,’ returned the Carrier.', '‘It’s a crisis.’\\n\\n‘It is,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Come here, man!’\\n\\nThere was that in his pale face which made the other rise immediately,\\nand ask him, in a hurry, what the matter was.', '‘Hush!', 'John Peerybingle,’ said Tackleton.', '‘I am sorry for this.', 'I am\\nindeed.', 'I have been afraid of it.', 'I have suspected it from the first.’\\n\\n‘What is it?’ asked the Carrier, with a frightened aspect.', '‘Hush!', 'I’ll show you, if you’ll come with me.’\\n\\nThe Carrier accompanied him, without another word.', 'They went across a\\nyard, where the stars were shining, and by a little side-door, into\\nTackleton’s own counting-house, where there was a glass window,\\ncommanding the ware-room, which was closed for the night.', 'There was no\\nlight in the counting-house itself, but there were lamps in the long\\nnarrow ware-room; and consequently the window was bright.', '‘A moment!’ said Tackleton.', '‘Can you bear to look through that window,\\ndo you think?’\\n\\n‘Why not?’ returned the Carrier.', '‘A moment more,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Don’t commit any violence.', 'It’s of no\\nuse.', 'It’s dangerous too.', 'You’re a strong-made man; and you might do\\nmurder before you know it.’\\n\\nThe Carrier looked him in the face, and recoiled a step as if he had been\\nstruck.', 'In one stride he was at the window, and he saw—\\n\\nOh Shadow on the Hearth!', 'Oh truthful Cricket!', 'Oh perfidious Wife!', 'He saw her, with the old man—old no longer, but erect and gallant—bearing\\nin his hand the false white hair that had won his way into their desolate\\nand miserable home.', 'He saw her listening to him, as he bent his head to\\nwhisper in her ear; and suffering him to clasp her round the waist, as\\nthey moved slowly down the dim wooden gallery towards the door by which\\nthey had entered it.', 'He saw them stop, and saw her turn—to have the\\nface, the face he loved so, so presented to his view!—and saw her, with\\nher own hands, adjust the lie upon his head, laughing, as she did it, at\\nhis unsuspicious nature!', 'He clenched his strong right hand at first, as if it would have beaten\\ndown a lion.', 'But opening it immediately again, he spread it out before\\nthe eyes of Tackleton (for he was tender of her, even then), and so, as\\nthey passed out, fell down upon a desk, and was as weak as any infant.', 'He was wrapped up to the chin, and busy with his horse and parcels, when\\nshe came into the room, prepared for going home.', '‘Now, John, dear!', 'Good night, May!', 'Good night, Bertha!’\\n\\nCould she kiss them?', 'Could she be blithe and cheerful in her parting?', 'Could she venture to reveal her face to them without a blush?', 'Yes.', 'Tackleton observed her closely, and she did all this.', 'Tilly was hushing the Baby, and she crossed and re-crossed Tackleton, a\\ndozen times, repeating drowsily:\\n\\n‘Did the knowledge that it was to be its wifes, then, wring its hearts\\nalmost to breaking; and did its fathers deceive it from its cradles but\\nto break its hearts at last!’\\n\\n‘Now, Tilly, give me the Baby!', 'Good night, Mr. Tackleton.', 'Where’s John,\\nfor goodness’ sake?’\\n\\n‘He’s going to walk beside the horse’s head,’ said Tackleton; who helped\\nher to her seat.', '‘My dear John.', 'Walk?', 'To-night?’\\n\\nThe muffled figure of her husband made a hasty sign in the affirmative;\\nand the false stranger and the little nurse being in their places, the\\nold horse moved off.', 'Boxer, the unconscious Boxer, running on before,\\nrunning back, running round and round the cart, and barking as\\ntriumphantly and merrily as ever.', 'When Tackleton had gone off likewise, escorting May and her mother home,\\npoor Caleb sat down by the fire beside his daughter; anxious and\\nremorseful at the core; and still saying in his wistful contemplation of\\nher, ‘Have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her heart at\\nlast!’\\n\\nThe toys that had been set in motion for the Baby, had all stopped, and\\nrun down, long ago.', 'In the faint light and silence, the imperturbably\\ncalm dolls, the agitated rocking-horses with distended eyes and nostrils,\\nthe old gentlemen at the street-doors, standing half doubled up upon\\ntheir failing knees and ankles, the wry-faced nut-crackers, the very\\nBeasts upon their way into the Ark, in twos, like a Boarding School out\\nwalking, might have been imagined to be stricken motionless with\\nfantastic wonder, at Dot being false, or Tackleton beloved, under any\\ncombination of circumstances.', 'CHAPTER III—Chirp the Third\\n\\n\\nThe Dutch clock in the corner struck Ten, when the Carrier sat down by\\nhis fireside.', 'So troubled and grief-worn, that he seemed to scare the\\nCuckoo, who, having cut his ten melodious announcements as short as\\npossible, plunged back into the Moorish Palace again, and clapped his\\nlittle door behind him, as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for\\nhis feelings.', 'If the little Haymaker had been armed with the sharpest of scythes, and\\nhad cut at every stroke into the Carrier’s heart, he never could have\\ngashed and wounded it, as Dot had done.', 'It was a heart so full of love for her; so bound up and held together by\\ninnumerable threads of winning remembrance, spun from the daily working\\nof her many qualities of endearment; it was a heart in which she had\\nenshrined herself so gently and so closely; a heart so single and so\\nearnest in its Truth, so strong in right, so weak in wrong; that it could\\ncherish neither passion nor revenge at first, and had only room to hold\\nthe broken image of its Idol.', 'But, slowly, slowly, as the Carrier sat brooding on his hearth, now cold\\nand dark, other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him, as an\\nangry wind comes rising in the night.', 'The Stranger was beneath his\\noutraged roof.', 'Three steps would take him to his chamber-door.', 'One blow\\nwould beat it in.', '‘You might do murder before you know it,’ Tackleton\\nhad said.', 'How could it be murder, if he gave the villain time to grapple\\nwith him hand to hand!', 'He was the younger man.', 'It was an ill-timed thought, bad for the dark mood of his mind.', 'It was\\nan angry thought, goading him to some avenging act, that should change\\nthe cheerful house into a haunted place which lonely travellers would\\ndread to pass by night; and where the timid would see shadows struggling\\nin the ruined windows when the moon was dim, and hear wild noises in the\\nstormy weather.', 'He was the younger man!', 'Yes, yes; some lover who had won the heart that\\n_he_ had never touched.', 'Some lover of her early choice, of whom she had\\nthought and dreamed, for whom she had pined and pined, when he had\\nfancied her so happy by his side.', 'O agony to think of it!', 'She had been above-stairs with the Baby, getting it to bed.', 'As he sat\\nbrooding on the hearth, she came close beside him, without his\\nknowledge—in the turning of the rack of his great misery, he lost all\\nother sounds—and put her little stool at his feet.', 'He only knew it, when\\nhe felt her hand upon his own, and saw her looking up into his face.', 'With wonder?', 'No.', 'It was his first impression, and he was fain to look\\nat her again, to set it right.', 'No, not with wonder.', 'With an eager and\\ninquiring look; but not with wonder.', 'At first it was alarmed and\\nserious; then, it changed into a strange, wild, dreadful smile of\\nrecognition of his thoughts; then, there was nothing but her clasped\\nhands on her brow, and her bent head, and falling hair.', 'Though the power of Omnipotence had been his to wield at that moment, he\\nhad too much of its diviner property of Mercy in his breast, to have\\nturned one feather’s weight of it against her.', 'But he could not bear to\\nsee her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on\\nher, with love and pride, so innocent and gay; and, when she rose and\\nleft him, sobbing as she went, he felt it a relief to have the vacant\\nplace beside him rather than her so long-cherished presence.', 'This in\\nitself was anguish keener than all, reminding him how desolate he was\\nbecome, and how the great bond of his life was rent asunder.', 'The more he felt this, and the more he knew he could have better borne to\\nsee her lying prematurely dead before him with their little child upon\\nher breast, the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy.', 'He looked about him for a weapon.', 'There was a gun, hanging on the wall.', 'He took it down, and moved a pace\\nor two towards the door of the perfidious Stranger’s room.', 'He knew the\\ngun was loaded.', 'Some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man\\nlike a wild beast, seized him, and dilated in his mind until it grew into\\na monstrous demon in complete possession of him, casting out all milder\\nthoughts and setting up its undivided empire.', 'That phrase is wrong.', 'Not casting out his milder thoughts, but artfully\\ntransforming them.', 'Changing them into scourges to drive him on.', 'Turning\\nwater into blood, love into hate, gentleness into blind ferocity.', 'Her\\nimage, sorrowing, humbled, but still pleading to his tenderness and mercy\\nwith resistless power, never left his mind; but, staying there, it urged\\nhim to the door; raised the weapon to his shoulder; fitted and nerved his\\nfinger to the trigger; and cried ‘Kill him!', 'In his bed!’\\n\\nHe reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the door; he already held it\\nlifted in the air; some indistinct design was in his thoughts of calling\\nout to him to fly, for God’s sake, by the window—\\n\\nWhen, suddenly, the struggling fire illumined the whole chimney with a\\nglow of light; and the Cricket on the Hearth began to Chirp!', 'No sound he could have heard, no human voice, not even hers, could so\\nhave moved and softened him.', 'The artless words in which she had told him\\nof her love for this same Cricket, were once more freshly spoken; her\\ntrembling, earnest manner at the moment, was again before him; her\\npleasant voice—O what a voice it was, for making household music at the\\nfireside of an honest man!—thrilled through and through his better\\nnature, and awoke it into life and action.', 'He recoiled from the door, like a man walking in his sleep, awakened from\\na frightful dream; and put the gun aside.', 'Clasping his hands before his\\nface, he then sat down again beside the fire, and found relief in tears.', 'The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in Fairy\\nshape before him.', '‘“I love it,”’ said the Fairy Voice, repeating what he well remembered,\\n‘“for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless\\nmusic has given me.”’\\n\\n‘She said so!’ cried the Carrier.', '‘True!’\\n\\n‘“This has been a happy home, John; and I love the Cricket for its\\nsake!”’\\n\\n‘It has been, Heaven knows,’ returned the Carrier.', '‘She made it happy,\\nalways,—until now.’\\n\\n‘So gracefully sweet-tempered; so domestic, joyful, busy, and\\nlight-hearted!’ said the Voice.', '‘Otherwise I never could have loved her as I did,’ returned the Carrier.', 'The Voice, correcting him, said ‘do.’\\n\\nThe Carrier repeated ‘as I did.’  But not firmly.', 'His faltering tongue\\nresisted his control, and would speak in its own way, for itself and him.', 'The Figure, in an attitude of invocation, raised its hand and said:\\n\\n‘Upon your own hearth—’\\n\\n‘The hearth she has blighted,’ interposed the Carrier.', '‘The hearth she has—how often!—blessed and brightened,’ said the Cricket;\\n‘the hearth which, but for her, were only a few stones and bricks and\\nrusty bars, but which has been, through her, the Altar of your Home; on\\nwhich you have nightly sacrificed some petty passion, selfishness, or\\ncare, and offered up the homage of a tranquil mind, a trusting nature,\\nand an overflowing heart; so that the smoke from this poor chimney has\\ngone upward with a better fragrance than the richest incense that is\\nburnt before the richest shrines in all the gaudy temples of this\\nworld!—Upon your own hearth; in its quiet sanctuary; surrounded by its\\ngentle influences and associations; hear her!', 'Hear me!', 'Hear everything\\nthat speaks the language of your hearth and home!’\\n\\n‘And pleads for her?’ inquired the Carrier.', '‘All things that speak the language of your hearth and home, must plead\\nfor her!’ returned the Cricket.', '‘For they speak the truth.’\\n\\nAnd while the Carrier, with his head upon his hands, continued to sit\\nmeditating in his chair, the Presence stood beside him, suggesting his\\nreflections by its power, and presenting them before him, as in a glass\\nor picture.', 'It was not a solitary Presence.', 'From the hearthstone, from\\nthe chimney, from the clock, the pipe, the kettle, and the cradle; from\\nthe floor, the walls, the ceiling, and the stairs; from the cart without,\\nand the cupboard within, and the household implements; from every thing\\nand every place with which she had ever been familiar, and with which she\\nhad ever entwined one recollection of herself in her unhappy husband’s\\nmind; Fairies came trooping forth.', 'Not to stand beside him as the\\nCricket did, but to busy and bestir themselves.', 'To do all honour to her\\nimage.', 'To pull him by the skirts, and point to it when it appeared.', 'To\\ncluster round it, and embrace it, and strew flowers for it to tread on.', 'To try to crown its fair head with their tiny hands.', 'To show that they\\nwere fond of it and loved it; and that there was not one ugly, wicked or\\naccusatory creature to claim knowledge of it—none but their playful and\\napproving selves.', 'His thoughts were constant to her image.', 'It was always there.', 'She sat plying her needle, before the fire, and singing to herself.', 'Such\\na blithe, thriving, steady little Dot!', 'The fairy figures turned upon him\\nall at once, by one consent, with one prodigious concentrated stare, and\\nseemed to say, ‘Is this the light wife you are mourning for!’\\n\\nThere were sounds of gaiety outside, musical instruments, and noisy\\ntongues, and laughter.', 'A crowd of young merry-makers came pouring in,\\namong whom were May Fielding and a score of pretty girls.', 'Dot was the\\nfairest of them all; as young as any of them too.', 'They came to summon\\nher to join their party.', 'It was a dance.', 'If ever little foot were made\\nfor dancing, hers was, surely.', 'But she laughed, and shook her head, and\\npointed to her cookery on the fire, and her table ready spread: with an\\nexulting defiance that rendered her more charming than she was before.', 'And so she merrily dismissed them, nodding to her would-be partners, one\\nby one, as they passed, but with a comical indifference, enough to make\\nthem go and drown themselves immediately if they were her admirers—and\\nthey must have been so, more or less; they couldn’t help it.', 'And yet\\nindifference was not her character.', 'O no!', 'For presently, there came a\\ncertain Carrier to the door; and bless her what a welcome she bestowed\\nupon him!', 'Again the staring figures turned upon him all at once, and seemed to say,\\n‘Is this the wife who has forsaken you!’\\n\\nA shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture: call it what you will.', 'A\\ngreat shadow of the Stranger, as he first stood underneath their roof;\\ncovering its surface, and blotting out all other objects.', 'But the nimble\\nFairies worked like bees to clear it off again.', 'And Dot again was there.', 'Still bright and beautiful.', 'Rocking her little Baby in its cradle, singing to it softly, and resting\\nher head upon a shoulder which had its counterpart in the musing figure\\nby which the Fairy Cricket stood.', 'The night—I mean the real night: not going by Fairy clocks—was wearing\\nnow; and in this stage of the Carrier’s thoughts, the moon burst out, and\\nshone brightly in the sky.', 'Perhaps some calm and quiet light had risen\\nalso, in his mind; and he could think more soberly of what had happened.', 'Although the shadow of the Stranger fell at intervals upon the\\nglass—always distinct, and big, and thoroughly defined—it never fell so\\ndarkly as at first.', 'Whenever it appeared, the Fairies uttered a general\\ncry of consternation, and plied their little arms and legs, with\\ninconceivable activity, to rub it out.', 'And whenever they got at Dot\\nagain, and showed her to him once more, bright and beautiful, they\\ncheered in the most inspiring manner.', 'They never showed her, otherwise than beautiful and bright, for they were\\nHousehold Spirits to whom falsehood is annihilation; and being so, what\\nDot was there for them, but the one active, beaming, pleasant little\\ncreature who had been the light and sun of the Carrier’s Home!', 'The Fairies were prodigiously excited when they showed her, with the\\nBaby, gossiping among a knot of sage old matrons, and affecting to be\\nwondrous old and matronly herself, and leaning in a staid, demure old way\\nupon her husband’s arm, attempting—she!', 'such a bud of a little woman—to\\nconvey the idea of having abjured the vanities of the world in general,\\nand of being the sort of person to whom it was no novelty at all to be a\\nmother; yet in the same breath, they showed her, laughing at the Carrier\\nfor being awkward, and pulling up his shirt-collar to make him smart, and\\nmincing merrily about that very room to teach him how to dance!', 'They turned, and stared immensely at him when they showed her with the\\nBlind Girl; for, though she carried cheerfulness and animation with her\\nwheresoever she went, she bore those influences into Caleb Plummer’s\\nhome, heaped up and running over.', 'The Blind Girl’s love for her, and\\ntrust in her, and gratitude to her; her own good busy way of setting\\nBertha’s thanks aside; her dexterous little arts for filling up each\\nmoment of the visit in doing something useful to the house, and really\\nworking hard while feigning to make holiday; her bountiful provision of\\nthose standing delicacies, the Veal and Ham-Pie and the bottles of Beer;\\nher radiant little face arriving at the door, and taking leave; the\\nwonderful expression in her whole self, from her neat foot to the crown\\nof her head, of being a part of the establishment—a something necessary\\nto it, which it couldn’t be without; all this the Fairies revelled in,\\nand loved her for.', 'And once again they looked upon him all at once,\\nappealingly, and seemed to say, while some among them nestled in her\\ndress and fondled her, ‘Is this the wife who has betrayed your\\nconfidence!’\\n\\nMore than once, or twice, or thrice, in the long thoughtful night, they\\nshowed her to him sitting on her favourite seat, with her bent head, her\\nhands clasped on her brow, her falling hair.', 'As he had seen her last.', 'And when they found her thus, they neither turned nor looked upon him,\\nbut gathered close round her, and comforted and kissed her, and pressed\\non one another to show sympathy and kindness to her, and forgot him\\naltogether.', 'Thus the night passed.', 'The moon went down; the stars grew pale; the cold\\nday broke; the sun rose.', 'The Carrier still sat, musing, in the chimney\\ncorner.', 'He had sat there, with his head upon his hands, all night.', 'All\\nnight the faithful Cricket had been Chirp, Chirp, Chirping on the Hearth.', 'All night he had listened to its voice.', 'All night the household Fairies\\nhad been busy with him.', 'All night she had been amiable and blameless in\\nthe glass, except when that one shadow fell upon it.', 'He rose up when it was broad day, and washed and dressed himself.', 'He\\ncouldn’t go about his customary cheerful avocations—he wanted spirit for\\nthem—but it mattered the less, that it was Tackleton’s wedding-day, and\\nhe had arranged to make his rounds by proxy.', 'He thought to have gone\\nmerrily to church with Dot.', 'But such plans were at an end.', 'It was their\\nown wedding-day too.', 'Ah!', 'how little he had looked for such a close to\\nsuch a year!', 'The Carrier had expected that Tackleton would pay him an early visit; and\\nhe was right.', 'He had not walked to and fro before his own door, many\\nminutes, when he saw the Toy-merchant coming in his chaise along the\\nroad.', 'As the chaise drew nearer, he perceived that Tackleton was dressed\\nout sprucely for his marriage, and that he had decorated his horse’s head\\nwith flowers and favours.', 'The horse looked much more like a bridegroom than Tackleton, whose\\nhalf-closed eye was more disagreeably expressive than ever.', 'But the\\nCarrier took little heed of this.', 'His thoughts had other occupation.', '‘John Peerybingle!’ said Tackleton, with an air of condolence.', '‘My good\\nfellow, how do you find yourself this morning?’\\n\\n‘I have had but a poor night, Master Tackleton,’ returned the Carrier,\\nshaking his head: ‘for I have been a good deal disturbed in my mind.', 'But\\nit’s over now!', 'Can you spare me half an hour or so, for some private\\ntalk?’\\n\\n‘I came on purpose,’ returned Tackleton, alighting.', '‘Never mind the\\nhorse.', 'He’ll stand quiet enough, with the reins over this post, if\\nyou’ll give him a mouthful of hay.’\\n\\nThe Carrier having brought it from his stable, and set it before him,\\nthey turned into the house.', '‘You are not married before noon,’ he said, ‘I think?’\\n\\n‘No,’ answered Tackleton.', '‘Plenty of time.', 'Plenty of time.’\\n\\nWhen they entered the kitchen, Tilly Slowboy was rapping at the\\nStranger’s door; which was only removed from it by a few steps.', 'One of\\nher very red eyes (for Tilly had been crying all night long, because her\\nmistress cried) was at the keyhole; and she was knocking very loud; and\\nseemed frightened.', '‘If you please I can’t make nobody hear,’ said Tilly, looking round.', '‘I\\nhope nobody an’t gone and been and died if you please!’\\n\\nThis philanthropic wish, Miss Slowboy emphasised with various new raps\\nand kicks at the door; which led to no result whatever.', '‘Shall I go?’ said Tackleton.', '‘It’s curious.’\\n\\nThe Carrier, who had turned his face from the door, signed to him to go\\nif he would.', 'So Tackleton went to Tilly Slowboy’s relief; and he too kicked and\\nknocked; and he too failed to get the least reply.', 'But he thought of\\ntrying the handle of the door; and as it opened easily, he peeped in,\\nlooked in, went in, and soon came running out again.', '‘John Peerybingle,’ said Tackleton, in his ear.', '‘I hope there has been\\nnothing—nothing rash in the night?’\\n\\nThe Carrier turned upon him quickly.', '‘Because he’s gone!’ said Tackleton; ‘and the window’s open.', 'I don’t see\\nany marks—to be sure it’s almost on a level with the garden: but I was\\nafraid there might have been some—some scuffle.', 'Eh?’\\n\\nHe nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether; he looked at him so\\nhard.', 'And he gave his eye, and his face, and his whole person, a sharp\\ntwist.', 'As if he would have screwed the truth out of him.', '‘Make yourself easy,’ said the Carrier.', '‘He went into that room last\\nnight, without harm in word or deed from me, and no one has entered it\\nsince.', 'He is away of his own free will.', 'I’d go out gladly at that door,\\nand beg my bread from house to house, for life, if I could so change the\\npast that he had never come.', 'But he has come and gone.', 'And I have done\\nwith him!’\\n\\n‘Oh!—Well, I think he has got off pretty easy,’ said Tackleton, taking a\\nchair.', 'The sneer was lost upon the Carrier, who sat down too, and shaded his\\nface with his hand, for some little time, before proceeding.', '‘You showed me last night,’ he said at length, ‘my wife; my wife that I\\nlove; secretly—’\\n\\n‘And tenderly,’ insinuated Tackleton.', '‘Conniving at that man’s disguise, and giving him opportunities of\\nmeeting her alone.', 'I think there’s no sight I wouldn’t have rather seen\\nthan that.', 'I think there’s no man in the world I wouldn’t have rather\\nhad to show it me.’\\n\\n‘I confess to having had my suspicions always,’ said Tackleton.', '‘And\\nthat has made me objectionable here, I know.’\\n\\n‘But as you did show it me,’ pursued the Carrier, not minding him; ‘and\\nas you saw her, my wife, my wife that I love’—his voice, and eye, and\\nhand, grew steadier and firmer as he repeated these words: evidently in\\npursuance of a steadfast purpose—‘as you saw her at this disadvantage, it\\nis right and just that you should also see with my eyes, and look into my\\nbreast, and know what my mind is, upon the subject.', 'For it’s settled,’\\nsaid the Carrier, regarding him attentively.', '‘And nothing can shake it\\nnow.’\\n\\nTackleton muttered a few general words of assent, about its being\\nnecessary to vindicate something or other; but he was overawed by the\\nmanner of his companion.', 'Plain and unpolished as it was, it had a\\nsomething dignified and noble in it, which nothing but the soul of\\ngenerous honour dwelling in the man could have imparted.', '‘I am a plain, rough man,’ pursued the Carrier, ‘with very little to\\nrecommend me.', 'I am not a clever man, as you very well know.', 'I am not a\\nyoung man.', 'I loved my little Dot, because I had seen her grow up, from a\\nchild, in her father’s house; because I knew how precious she was;\\nbecause she had been my life, for years and years.', 'There’s many men I\\ncan’t compare with, who never could have loved my little Dot like me, I\\nthink!’\\n\\nHe paused, and softly beat the ground a short time with his foot, before\\nresuming.', '‘I often thought that though I wasn’t good enough for her, I should make\\nher a kind husband, and perhaps know her value better than another; and\\nin this way I reconciled it to myself, and came to think it might be\\npossible that we should be married.', 'And in the end it came about, and we\\nwere married.’\\n\\n‘Hah!’ said Tackleton, with a significant shake of the head.', '‘I had studied myself; I had had experience of myself; I knew how much I\\nloved her, and how happy I should be,’ pursued the Carrier.', '‘But I had\\nnot—I feel it now—sufficiently considered her.’\\n\\n‘To be sure,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Giddiness, frivolity, fickleness, love of\\nadmiration!', 'Not considered!', 'All left out of sight!', 'Hah!’\\n\\n‘You had best not interrupt me,’ said the Carrier, with some sternness,\\n‘till you understand me; and you’re wide of doing so.', 'If, yesterday, I’d\\nhave struck that man down at a blow, who dared to breathe a word against\\nher, to-day I’d set my foot upon his face, if he was my brother!’\\n\\nThe Toy-merchant gazed at him in astonishment.', 'He went on in a softer\\ntone:\\n\\n‘Did I consider,’ said the Carrier, ‘that I took her—at her age, and with\\nher beauty—from her young companions, and the many scenes of which she\\nwas the ornament; in which she was the brightest little star that ever\\nshone, to shut her up from day to day in my dull house, and keep my\\ntedious company?', 'Did I consider how little suited I was to her sprightly\\nhumour, and how wearisome a plodding man like me must be, to one of her\\nquick spirit?', 'Did I consider that it was no merit in me, or claim in me,\\nthat I loved her, when everybody must, who knew her?', 'Never.', 'I took\\nadvantage of her hopeful nature and her cheerful disposition; and I\\nmarried her.', 'I wish I never had!', 'For her sake; not for mine!’\\n\\nThe Toy-merchant gazed at him, without winking.', 'Even the half-shut eye\\nwas open now.', '‘Heaven bless her!’ said the Carrier, ‘for the cheerful constancy with\\nwhich she tried to keep the knowledge of this from me!', 'And Heaven help\\nme, that, in my slow mind, I have not found it out before!', 'Poor child!', 'Poor Dot!', '_I_ not to find it out, who have seen her eyes fill with\\ntears, when such a marriage as our own was spoken of!', 'I, who have seen\\nthe secret trembling on her lips a hundred times, and never suspected it\\ntill last night!', 'Poor girl!', 'That I could ever hope she would be fond of\\nme!', 'That I could ever believe she was!’\\n\\n‘She made a show of it,’ said Tackleton.', '‘She made such a show of it,\\nthat to tell you the truth it was the origin of my misgivings.’\\n\\nAnd here he asserted the superiority of May Fielding, who certainly made\\nno sort of show of being fond of _him_.', '‘She has tried,’ said the poor Carrier, with greater emotion than he had\\nexhibited yet; ‘I only now begin to know how hard she has tried, to be my\\ndutiful and zealous wife.', 'How good she has been; how much she has done;\\nhow brave and strong a heart she has; let the happiness I have known\\nunder this roof bear witness!', 'It will be some help and comfort to me,\\nwhen I am here alone.’\\n\\n‘Here alone?’ said Tackleton.', '‘Oh!', 'Then you do mean to take some notice\\nof this?’\\n\\n‘I mean,’ returned the Carrier, ‘to do her the greatest kindness, and\\nmake her the best reparation, in my power.', 'I can release her from the\\ndaily pain of an unequal marriage, and the struggle to conceal it.', 'She\\nshall be as free as I can render her.’\\n\\n‘Make _her_ reparation!’ exclaimed Tackleton, twisting and turning his\\ngreat ears with his hands.', '‘There must be something wrong here.', 'You\\ndidn’t say that, of course.’\\n\\nThe Carrier set his grip upon the collar of the Toy-merchant, and shook\\nhim like a reed.', '‘Listen to me!’ he said.', '‘And take care that you hear me right.', 'Listen\\nto me.', 'Do I speak plainly?’\\n\\n‘Very plainly indeed,’ answered Tackleton.', '‘As if I meant it?’\\n\\n‘Very much as if you meant it.’\\n\\n‘I sat upon that hearth, last night, all night,’ exclaimed the Carrier.', '‘On the spot where she has often sat beside me, with her sweet face\\nlooking into mine.', 'I called up her whole life, day by day.', 'I had her\\ndear self, in its every passage, in review before me.', 'And upon my soul\\nshe is innocent, if there is One to judge the innocent and guilty!’\\n\\nStaunch Cricket on the Hearth!', 'Loyal household Fairies!', '‘Passion and distrust have left me!’ said the Carrier; ‘and nothing but\\nmy grief remains.', 'In an unhappy moment some old lover, better suited to\\nher tastes and years than I; forsaken, perhaps, for me, against her will;\\nreturned.', 'In an unhappy moment, taken by surprise, and wanting time to\\nthink of what she did, she made herself a party to his treachery, by\\nconcealing it.', 'Last night she saw him, in the interview we witnessed.', 'It was wrong.', 'But otherwise than this she is innocent if there is truth\\non earth!’\\n\\n‘If that is your opinion’—Tackleton began.', '‘So, let her go!’ pursued the Carrier.', '‘Go, with my blessing for the\\nmany happy hours she has given me, and my forgiveness for any pang she\\nhas caused me.', 'Let her go, and have the peace of mind I wish her!', 'She’ll never hate me.', 'She’ll learn to like me better, when I’m not a\\ndrag upon her, and she wears the chain I have riveted, more lightly.', 'This is the day on which I took her, with so little thought for her\\nenjoyment, from her home.', 'To-day she shall return to it, and I will\\ntrouble her no more.', 'Her father and mother will be here to-day—we had\\nmade a little plan for keeping it together—and they shall take her home.', 'I can trust her, there, or anywhere.', 'She leaves me without blame, and\\nshe will live so I am sure.', 'If I should die—I may perhaps while she is\\nstill young; I have lost some courage in a few hours—she’ll find that I\\nremembered her, and loved her to the last!', 'This is the end of what you\\nshowed me.', 'Now, it’s over!’\\n\\n‘O no, John, not over.', 'Do not say it’s over yet!', 'Not quite yet.', 'I have\\nheard your noble words.', 'I could not steal away, pretending to be\\nignorant of what has affected me with such deep gratitude.', 'Do not say\\nit’s over, ‘till the clock has struck again!’\\n\\nShe had entered shortly after Tackleton, and had remained there.', 'She\\nnever looked at Tackleton, but fixed her eyes upon her husband.', 'But she\\nkept away from him, setting as wide a space as possible between them; and\\nthough she spoke with most impassioned earnestness, she went no nearer to\\nhim even then.', 'How different in this from her old self!', '‘No hand can make the clock which will strike again for me the hours that\\nare gone,’ replied the Carrier, with a faint smile.', '‘But let it be so,\\nif you will, my dear.', 'It will strike soon.', 'It’s of little matter what\\nwe say.', 'I’d try to please you in a harder case than that.’\\n\\n‘Well!’ muttered Tackleton.', '‘I must be off, for when the clock strikes\\nagain, it’ll be necessary for me to be upon my way to church.', 'Good\\nmorning, John Peerybingle.', 'I’m sorry to be deprived of the pleasure of\\nyour company.', 'Sorry for the loss, and the occasion of it too!’\\n\\n‘I have spoken plainly?’ said the Carrier, accompanying him to the door.', '‘Oh quite!’\\n\\n‘And you’ll remember what I have said?’\\n\\n‘Why, if you compel me to make the observation,’ said Tackleton,\\npreviously taking the precaution of getting into his chaise; ‘I must say\\nthat it was so very unexpected, that I’m far from being likely to forget\\nit.’\\n\\n‘The better for us both,’ returned the Carrier.', '‘Good bye.', 'I give you\\njoy!’\\n\\n‘I wish I could give it to _you_,’ said Tackleton.', '‘As I can’t;\\nthank’ee.', 'Between ourselves, (as I told you before, eh?)', 'I don’t much\\nthink I shall have the less joy in my married life, because May hasn’t\\nbeen too officious about me, and too demonstrative.', 'Good bye!', 'Take care\\nof yourself.’\\n\\nThe Carrier stood looking after him until he was smaller in the distance\\nthan his horse’s flowers and favours near at hand; and then, with a deep\\nsigh, went strolling like a restless, broken man, among some neighbouring\\nelms; unwilling to return until the clock was on the eve of striking.', 'His little wife, being left alone, sobbed piteously; but often dried her\\neyes and checked herself, to say how good he was, how excellent he was!', 'and once or twice she laughed; so heartily, triumphantly, and\\nincoherently (still crying all the time), that Tilly was quite horrified.', '‘Ow if you please don’t!’ said Tilly.', '‘It’s enough to dead and bury the\\nBaby, so it is if you please.’\\n\\n‘Will you bring him sometimes, to see his father, Tilly,’ inquired her\\nmistress, drying her eyes; ‘when I can’t live here, and have gone to my\\nold home?’\\n\\n‘Ow if you please don’t!’ cried Tilly, throwing back her head, and\\nbursting out into a howl—she looked at the moment uncommonly like Boxer.', '‘Ow if you please don’t!', 'Ow, what has everybody gone and been and done\\nwith everybody, making everybody else so wretched!', 'Ow-w-w-w!’\\n\\nThe soft-hearted Slowboy trailed off at this juncture, into such a\\ndeplorable howl, the more tremendous from its long suppression, that she\\nmust infallibly have awakened the Baby, and frightened him into something\\nserious (probably convulsions), if her eyes had not encountered Caleb\\nPlummer, leading in his daughter.', 'This spectacle restoring her to a\\nsense of the proprieties, she stood for some few moments silent, with her\\nmouth wide open; and then, posting off to the bed on which the Baby lay\\nasleep, danced in a weird, Saint Vitus manner on the floor, and at the\\nsame time rummaged with her face and head among the bedclothes,\\napparently deriving much relief from those extraordinary operations.', '‘Mary!’ said Bertha.', '‘Not at the marriage!’\\n\\n‘I told her you would not be there, mum,’ whispered Caleb.', '‘I heard as\\nmuch last night.', 'But bless you,’ said the little man, taking her\\ntenderly by both hands, ‘I don’t care for what they say.', 'I don’t believe\\nthem.', 'There an’t much of me, but that little should be torn to pieces\\nsooner than I’d trust a word against you!’\\n\\nHe put his arms about her and hugged her, as a child might have hugged\\none of his own dolls.', '‘Bertha couldn’t stay at home this morning,’ said Caleb.', '‘She was\\nafraid, I know, to hear the bells ring, and couldn’t trust herself to be\\nso near them on their wedding-day.', 'So we started in good time, and came\\nhere.', 'I have been thinking of what I have done,’ said Caleb, after a\\nmoment’s pause; ‘I have been blaming myself till I hardly knew what to do\\nor where to turn, for the distress of mind I have caused her; and I’ve\\ncome to the conclusion that I’d better, if you’ll stay with me, mum, the\\nwhile, tell her the truth.', 'You’ll stay with me the while?’ he inquired,\\ntrembling from head to foot.', '‘I don’t know what effect it may have upon\\nher; I don’t know what she’ll think of me; I don’t know that she’ll ever\\ncare for her poor father afterwards.', 'But it’s best for her that she\\nshould be undeceived, and I must bear the consequences as I deserve!’\\n\\n‘Mary,’ said Bertha, ‘where is your hand!', 'Ah!', 'Here it is here it is!’\\npressing it to her lips, with a smile, and drawing it through her arm.', '‘I heard them speaking softly among themselves, last night, of some blame\\nagainst you.', 'They were wrong.’\\n\\nThe Carrier’s Wife was silent.', 'Caleb answered for her.', '‘They were wrong,’ he said.', '‘I knew it!’ cried Bertha, proudly.', '‘I told them so.', 'I scorned to hear\\na word!', 'Blame _her_ with justice!’ she pressed the hand between her own,\\nand the soft cheek against her face.', '‘No!', 'I am not so blind as that.’\\n\\nHer father went on one side of her, while Dot remained upon the other:\\nholding her hand.', '‘I know you all,’ said Bertha, ‘better than you think.', 'But none so well\\nas her.', 'Not even you, father.', 'There is nothing half so real and so true\\nabout me, as she is.', 'If I could be restored to sight this instant, and\\nnot a word were spoken, I could choose her from a crowd!', 'My sister!’\\n\\n‘Bertha, my dear!’ said Caleb, ‘I have something on my mind I want to\\ntell you, while we three are alone.', 'Hear me kindly!', 'I have a confession\\nto make to you, my darling.’\\n\\n‘A confession, father?’\\n\\n‘I have wandered from the truth and lost myself, my child,’ said Caleb,\\nwith a pitiable expression in his bewildered face.', '‘I have wandered from\\nthe truth, intending to be kind to you; and have been cruel.’\\n\\nShe turned her wonder-stricken face towards him, and repeated ‘Cruel!’\\n\\n‘He accuses himself too strongly, Bertha,’ said Dot.', '‘You’ll say so,\\npresently.', 'You’ll be the first to tell him so.’\\n\\n‘He cruel to me!’ cried Bertha, with a smile of incredulity.', '‘Not meaning it, my child,’ said Caleb.', '‘But I have been; though I never\\nsuspected it, till yesterday.', 'My dear blind daughter, hear me and\\nforgive me!', 'The world you live in, heart of mine, doesn’t exist as I\\nhave represented it.', 'The eyes you have trusted in, have been false to\\nyou.’\\n\\nShe turned her wonder-stricken face towards him still; but drew back, and\\nclung closer to her friend.', '‘Your road in life was rough, my poor one,’ said Caleb, ‘and I meant to\\nsmooth it for you.', 'I have altered objects, changed the characters of\\npeople, invented many things that never have been, to make you happier.', 'I have had concealments from you, put deceptions on you, God forgive me!', 'and surrounded you with fancies.’\\n\\n‘But living people are not fancies!’ she said hurriedly, and turning very\\npale, and still retiring from him.', '‘You can’t change them.’\\n\\n‘I have done so, Bertha,’ pleaded Caleb.', '‘There is one person that you\\nknow, my dove—’\\n\\n‘Oh father!', 'why do you say, I know?’ she answered, in a term of keen\\nreproach.', '‘What and whom do _I_ know!', 'I who have no leader!', 'I so\\nmiserably blind.’\\n\\nIn the anguish of her heart, she stretched out her hands, as if she were\\ngroping her way; then spread them, in a manner most forlorn and sad, upon\\nher face.', '‘The marriage that takes place to-day,’ said Caleb, ‘is with a stern,\\nsordid, grinding man.', 'A hard master to you and me, my dear, for many\\nyears.', 'Ugly in his looks, and in his nature.', 'Cold and callous always.', 'Unlike what I have painted him to you in everything, my child.', 'In\\neverything.’\\n\\n‘Oh why,’ cried the Blind Girl, tortured, as it seemed, almost beyond\\nendurance, ‘why did you ever do this!', 'Why did you ever fill my heart so\\nfull, and then come in like Death, and tear away the objects of my love!', 'O Heaven, how blind I am!', 'How helpless and alone!’\\n\\nHer afflicted father hung his head, and offered no reply but in his\\npenitence and sorrow.', 'She had been but a short time in this passion of regret, when the Cricket\\non the Hearth, unheard by all but her, began to chirp.', 'Not merrily, but\\nin a low, faint, sorrowing way.', 'It was so mournful that her tears began\\nto flow; and when the Presence which had been beside the Carrier all\\nnight, appeared behind her, pointing to her father, they fell down like\\nrain.', 'She heard the Cricket-voice more plainly soon, and was conscious, through\\nher blindness, of the Presence hovering about her father.', '‘Mary,’ said the Blind Girl, ‘tell me what my home is.', 'What it truly\\nis.’\\n\\n‘It is a poor place, Bertha; very poor and bare indeed.', 'The house will\\nscarcely keep out wind and rain another winter.', 'It is as roughly\\nshielded from the weather, Bertha,’ Dot continued in a low, clear voice,\\n‘as your poor father in his sack-cloth coat.’\\n\\nThe Blind Girl, greatly agitated, rose, and led the Carrier’s little wife\\naside.', '‘Those presents that I took such care of; that came almost at my wish,\\nand were so dearly welcome to me,’ she said, trembling; ‘where did they\\ncome from?', 'Did you send them?’\\n\\n‘No.’\\n\\n‘Who then?’\\n\\nDot saw she knew, already, and was silent.', 'The Blind Girl spread her\\nhands before her face again.', 'But in quite another manner now.', '‘Dear Mary, a moment.', 'One moment?', 'More this way.', 'Speak softly to me.', 'You are true, I know.', 'You’d not deceive me now; would you?’\\n\\n‘No, Bertha, indeed!’\\n\\n‘No, I am sure you would not.', 'You have too much pity for me.', 'Mary, look\\nacross the room to where we were just now—to where my father is—my\\nfather, so compassionate and loving to me—and tell me what you see.’\\n\\n‘I see,’ said Dot, who understood her well, ‘an old man sitting in a\\nchair, and leaning sorrowfully on the back, with his face resting on his\\nhand.', 'As if his child should comfort him, Bertha.’\\n\\n‘Yes, yes.', 'She will.', 'Go on.’\\n\\n‘He is an old man, worn with care and work.', 'He is a spare, dejected,\\nthoughtful, grey-haired man.', 'I see him now, despondent and bowed down,\\nand striving against nothing.', 'But, Bertha, I have seen him many times\\nbefore, and striving hard in many ways for one great sacred object.', 'And\\nI honour his grey head, and bless him!’\\n\\nThe Blind Girl broke away from her; and throwing herself upon her knees\\nbefore him, took the grey head to her breast.', '‘It is my sight restored.', 'It is my sight!’ she cried.', '‘I have been\\nblind, and now my eyes are open.', 'I never knew him!', 'To think I might\\nhave died, and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to me!’\\n\\nThere were no words for Caleb’s emotion.', '‘There is not a gallant figure on this earth,’ exclaimed the Blind Girl,\\nholding him in her embrace, ‘that I would love so dearly, and would\\ncherish so devotedly, as this!', 'The greyer, and more worn, the dearer,\\nfather!', 'Never let them say I am blind again.', 'There’s not a furrow in\\nhis face, there’s not a hair upon his head, that shall be forgotten in my\\nprayers and thanks to Heaven!’\\n\\nCaleb managed to articulate ‘My Bertha!’\\n\\n‘And in my blindness, I believed him,’ said the girl, caressing him with\\ntears of exquisite affection, ‘to be so different!', 'And having him beside\\nme, day by day, so mindful of me—always, never dreamed of this!’\\n\\n‘The fresh smart father in the blue coat, Bertha,’ said poor Caleb.', '‘He’s gone!’\\n\\n‘Nothing is gone,’ she answered.', '‘Dearest father, no!', 'Everything is\\nhere—in you.', 'The father that I loved so well; the father that I never\\nloved enough, and never knew; the benefactor whom I first began to\\nreverence and love, because he had such sympathy for me; All are here in\\nyou.', 'Nothing is dead to me.', 'The soul of all that was most dear to me is\\nhere—here, with the worn face, and the grey head.', 'And I am NOT blind,\\nfather, any longer!’\\n\\nDot’s whole attention had been concentrated, during this discourse, upon\\nthe father and daughter; but looking, now, towards the little Haymaker in\\nthe Moorish meadow, she saw that the clock was within a few minutes of\\nstriking, and fell, immediately, into a nervous and excited state.', '‘Father,’ said Bertha, hesitating.', '‘Mary.’\\n\\n‘Yes, my dear,’ returned Caleb.', '‘Here she is.’\\n\\n‘There is no change in _her_.', 'You never told me anything of _her_ that\\nwas not true?’\\n\\n‘I should have done it, my dear, I am afraid,’ returned Caleb, ‘if I\\ncould have made her better than she was.', 'But I must have changed her for\\nthe worse, if I had changed her at all.', 'Nothing could improve her,\\nBertha.’\\n\\nConfident as the Blind Girl had been when she asked the question, her\\ndelight and pride in the reply and her renewed embrace of Dot, were\\ncharming to behold.', '‘More changes than you think for, may happen though, my dear,’ said Dot.', '‘Changes for the better, I mean; changes for great joy to some of us.', 'You mustn’t let them startle you too much, if any such should ever\\nhappen, and affect you?', 'Are those wheels upon the road?', 'You’ve a quick\\near, Bertha.', 'Are they wheels?’\\n\\n‘Yes.', 'Coming very fast.’\\n\\n‘I—I—I know you have a quick ear,’ said Dot, placing her hand upon her\\nheart, and evidently talking on, as fast as she could to hide its\\npalpitating state, ‘because I have noticed it often, and because you were\\nso quick to find out that strange step last night.', 'Though why you should\\nhave said, as I very well recollect you did say, Bertha, “Whose step is\\nthat!” and why you should have taken any greater observation of it than\\nof any other step, I don’t know.', 'Though as I said just now, there are\\ngreat changes in the world: great changes: and we can’t do better than\\nprepare ourselves to be surprised at hardly anything.’\\n\\nCaleb wondered what this meant; perceiving that she spoke to him, no less\\nthan to his daughter.', 'He saw her, with astonishment, so fluttered and\\ndistressed that she could scarcely breathe; and holding to a chair, to\\nsave herself from falling.', '‘They are wheels indeed!’ she panted.', '‘Coming nearer!', 'Nearer!', 'Very\\nclose!', 'And now you hear them stopping at the garden-gate!', 'And now you\\nhear a step outside the door—the same step, Bertha, is it not!—and now!’—\\n\\nShe uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight; and running up to Caleb\\nput her hands upon his eyes, as a young man rushed into the room, and\\nflinging away his hat into the air, came sweeping down upon them.', '‘Is it over?’ cried Dot.', '‘Yes!’\\n\\n‘Happily over?’\\n\\n‘Yes!’\\n\\n‘Do you recollect the voice, dear Caleb?', 'Did you ever hear the like of\\nit before?’ cried Dot.', '‘If my boy in the Golden South Americas was alive’—said Caleb, trembling.', '‘He is alive!’ shrieked Dot, removing her hands from his eyes, and\\nclapping them in ecstasy; ‘look at him!', 'See where he stands before you,\\nhealthy and strong!', 'Your own dear son!', 'Your own dear living, loving\\nbrother, Bertha!’\\n\\nAll honour to the little creature for her transports!', 'All honour to her\\ntears and laughter, when the three were locked in one another’s arms!', 'All honour to the heartiness with which she met the sunburnt\\nsailor-fellow, with his dark streaming hair, half-way, and never turned\\nher rosy little mouth aside, but suffered him to kiss it, freely, and to\\npress her to his bounding heart!', 'And honour to the Cuckoo too—why not!—for bursting out of the trap-door\\nin the Moorish Palace like a house-breaker, and hiccoughing twelve times\\non the assembled company, as if he had got drunk for joy!', 'The Carrier, entering, started back.', 'And well he might, to find himself\\nin such good company.', '‘Look, John!’ said Caleb, exultingly, ‘look here!', 'My own boy from the\\nGolden South Americas!', 'My own son!', 'Him that you fitted out, and sent\\naway yourself!', 'Him that you were always such a friend to!’\\n\\nThe Carrier advanced to seize him by the hand; but, recoiling, as some\\nfeature in his face awakened a remembrance of the Deaf Man in the Cart,\\nsaid:\\n\\n‘Edward!', 'Was it you?’\\n\\n‘Now tell him all!’ cried Dot.', '‘Tell him all, Edward; and don’t spare\\nme, for nothing shall make me spare myself in his eyes, ever again.’\\n\\n‘I was the man,’ said Edward.', '‘And could you steal, disguised, into the house of your old friend?’\\nrejoined the Carrier.', '‘There was a frank boy once—how many years is it,\\nCaleb, since we heard that he was dead, and had it proved, we\\nthought?—who never would have done that.’\\n\\n‘There was a generous friend of mine, once; more a father to me than a\\nfriend;’ said Edward, ‘who never would have judged me, or any other man,\\nunheard.', 'You were he.', 'So I am certain you will hear me now.’\\n\\nThe Carrier, with a troubled glance at Dot, who still kept far away from\\nhim, replied, ‘Well!', 'that’s but fair.', 'I will.’\\n\\n‘You must know that when I left here, a boy,’ said Edward, ‘I was in\\nlove, and my love was returned.', 'She was a very young girl, who perhaps\\n(you may tell me) didn’t know her own mind.', 'But I knew mine, and I had a\\npassion for her.’\\n\\n‘You had!’ exclaimed the Carrier.', '‘You!’\\n\\n‘Indeed I had,’ returned the other.', '‘And she returned it.', 'I have ever\\nsince believed she did, and now I am sure she did.’\\n\\n‘Heaven help me!’ said the Carrier.', '‘This is worse than all.’\\n\\n‘Constant to her,’ said Edward, ‘and returning, full of hope, after many\\nhardships and perils, to redeem my part of our old contract, I heard,\\ntwenty miles away, that she was false to me; that she had forgotten me;\\nand had bestowed herself upon another and a richer man.', 'I had no mind to\\nreproach her; but I wished to see her, and to prove beyond dispute that\\nthis was true.', 'I hoped she might have been forced into it, against her\\nown desire and recollection.', 'It would be small comfort, but it would be\\nsome, I thought, and on I came.', 'That I might have the truth, the real\\ntruth; observing freely for myself, and judging for myself, without\\nobstruction on the one hand, or presenting my own influence (if I had\\nany) before her, on the other; I dressed myself unlike myself—you know\\nhow; and waited on the road—you know where.', 'You had no suspicion of me;\\nneither had—had she,’ pointing to Dot, ‘until I whispered in her ear at\\nthat fireside, and she so nearly betrayed me.’\\n\\n‘But when she knew that Edward was alive, and had come back,’ sobbed Dot,\\nnow speaking for herself, as she had burned to do, all through this\\nnarrative; ‘and when she knew his purpose, she advised him by all means\\nto keep his secret close; for his old friend John Peerybingle was much\\ntoo open in his nature, and too clumsy in all artifice—being a clumsy man\\nin general,’ said Dot, half laughing and half crying—‘to keep it for him.', 'And when she—that’s me, John,’ sobbed the little woman—‘told him all, and\\nhow his sweetheart had believed him to be dead; and how she had at last\\nbeen over-persuaded by her mother into a marriage which the silly, dear\\nold thing called advantageous; and when she—that’s me again, John—told\\nhim they were not yet married (though close upon it), and that it would\\nbe nothing but a sacrifice if it went on, for there was no love on her\\nside; and when he went nearly mad with joy to hear it; then she—that’s me\\nagain—said she would go between them, as she had often done before in old\\ntimes, John, and would sound his sweetheart and be sure that what she—me\\nagain, John—said and thought was right.', 'And it was right, John!', 'And\\nthey were brought together, John!', 'And they were married, John, an hour\\nago!', 'And here’s the Bride!', 'And Gruff and Tackleton may die a bachelor!', 'And I’m a happy little woman, May, God bless you!’\\n\\nShe was an irresistible little woman, if that be anything to the purpose;\\nand never so completely irresistible as in her present transports.', 'There\\nnever were congratulations so endearing and delicious, as those she\\nlavished on herself and on the Bride.', 'Amid the tumult of emotions in his breast, the honest Carrier had stood,\\nconfounded.', 'Flying, now, towards her, Dot stretched out her hand to stop\\nhim, and retreated as before.', '‘No, John, no!', 'Hear all!', 'Don’t love me any more, John, till you’ve\\nheard every word I have to say.', 'It was wrong to have a secret from you,\\nJohn.', 'I’m very sorry.', 'I didn’t think it any harm, till I came and sat\\ndown by you on the little stool last night.', 'But when I knew by what was\\nwritten in your face, that you had seen me walking in the gallery with\\nEdward, and when I knew what you thought, I felt how giddy and how wrong\\nit was.', 'But oh, dear John, how could you, could you, think so!’\\n\\nLittle woman, how she sobbed again!', 'John Peerybingle would have caught\\nher in his arms.', 'But no; she wouldn’t let him.', '‘Don’t love me yet, please, John!', 'Not for a long time yet!', 'When I was\\nsad about this intended marriage, dear, it was because I remembered May\\nand Edward such young lovers; and knew that her heart was far away from\\nTackleton.', 'You believe that, now.', 'Don’t you, John?’\\n\\nJohn was going to make another rush at this appeal; but she stopped him\\nagain.', '‘No; keep there, please, John!', 'When I laugh at you, as I sometimes do,\\nJohn, and call you clumsy and a dear old goose, and names of that sort,\\nit’s because I love you, John, so well, and take such pleasure in your\\nways, and wouldn’t see you altered in the least respect to have you made\\na King to-morrow.’\\n\\n‘Hooroar!’ said Caleb with unusual vigour.', '‘My opinion!’\\n\\n‘And when I speak of people being middle-aged, and steady, John, and\\npretend that we are a humdrum couple, going on in a jog-trot sort of way,\\nit’s only because I’m such a silly little thing, John, that I like,\\nsometimes, to act a kind of Play with Baby, and all that: and make\\nbelieve.’\\n\\nShe saw that he was coming; and stopped him again.', 'But she was very\\nnearly too late.', '‘No, don’t love me for another minute or two, if you please, John!', 'What\\nI want most to tell you, I have kept to the last.', 'My dear, good,\\ngenerous John, when we were talking the other night about the Cricket, I\\nhad it on my lips to say, that at first I did not love you quite so\\ndearly as I do now; that when I first came home here, I was half afraid I\\nmightn’t learn to love you every bit as well as I hoped and prayed I\\nmight—being so very young, John!', 'But, dear John, every day and hour I\\nloved you more and more.', 'And if I could have loved you better than I do,\\nthe noble words I heard you say this morning, would have made me.', 'But I\\ncan’t.', 'All the affection that I had (it was a great deal, John) I gave\\nyou, as you well deserve, long, long ago, and I have no more left to\\ngive.', 'Now, my dear husband, take me to your heart again!', 'That’s my\\nhome, John; and never, never think of sending me to any other!’\\n\\nYou never will derive so much delight from seeing a glorious little woman\\nin the arms of a third party, as you would have felt if you had seen Dot\\nrun into the Carrier’s embrace.', 'It was the most complete, unmitigated,\\nsoul-fraught little piece of earnestness that ever you beheld in all your\\ndays.', 'You may be sure the Carrier was in a state of perfect rapture; and you may\\nbe sure Dot was likewise; and you may be sure they all were, inclusive of\\nMiss Slowboy, who wept copiously for joy, and wishing to include her\\nyoung charge in the general interchange of congratulations, handed round\\nthe Baby to everybody in succession, as if it were something to drink.', 'But, now, the sound of wheels was heard again outside the door; and\\nsomebody exclaimed that Gruff and Tackleton was coming back.', 'Speedily\\nthat worthy gentleman appeared, looking warm and flustered.', '‘Why, what the Devil’s this, John Peerybingle!’ said Tackleton.', '‘There’s\\nsome mistake.', 'I appointed Mrs. Tackleton to meet me at the church, and\\nI’ll swear I passed her on the road, on her way here.', 'Oh!', 'here she is!', 'I beg your pardon, sir; I haven’t the pleasure of knowing you; but if you\\ncan do me the favour to spare this young lady, she has rather a\\nparticular engagement this morning.’\\n\\n‘But I can’t spare her,’ returned Edward.', '‘I couldn’t think of it.’\\n\\n‘What do you mean, you vagabond?’ said Tackleton.', '‘I mean, that as I can make allowance for your being vexed,’ returned the\\nother, with a smile, ‘I am as deaf to harsh discourse this morning, as I\\nwas to all discourse last night.’\\n\\nThe look that Tackleton bestowed upon him, and the start he gave!', '‘I am sorry, sir,’ said Edward, holding out May’s left hand, and\\nespecially the third finger; ‘that the young lady can’t accompany you to\\nchurch; but as she has been there once, this morning, perhaps you’ll\\nexcuse her.’\\n\\nTackleton looked hard at the third finger, and took a little piece of\\nsilver-paper, apparently containing a ring, from his waistcoat-pocket.', '‘Miss Slowboy,’ said Tackleton.', '‘Will you have the kindness to throw\\nthat in the fire?', 'Thank’ee.’\\n\\n‘It was a previous engagement, quite an old engagement, that prevented my\\nwife from keeping her appointment with you, I assure you,’ said Edward.', '‘Mr.', 'Tackleton will do me the justice to acknowledge that I revealed it\\nto him faithfully; and that I told him, many times, I never could forget\\nit,’ said May, blushing.', '‘Oh certainly!’ said Tackleton.', '‘Oh to be sure.', 'Oh it’s all right.', 'It’s quite correct.', 'Mrs. Edward Plummer, I infer?’\\n\\n‘That’s the name,’ returned the bridegroom.', '‘Ah, I shouldn’t have known you, sir,’ said Tackleton, scrutinising his\\nface narrowly, and making a low bow.', '‘I give you joy, sir!’\\n\\n‘Thank’ee.’\\n\\n‘Mrs.', 'Peerybingle,’ said Tackleton, turning suddenly to where she stood\\nwith her husband; ‘I am sorry.', 'You haven’t done me a very great\\nkindness, but, upon my life I am sorry.', 'You are better than I thought\\nyou.', 'John Peerybingle, I am sorry.', 'You understand me; that’s enough.', 'It’s quite correct, ladies and gentlemen all, and perfectly satisfactory.', 'Good morning!’\\n\\nWith these words he carried it off, and carried himself off too: merely\\nstopping at the door, to take the flowers and favours from his horse’s\\nhead, and to kick that animal once, in the ribs, as a means of informing\\nhim that there was a screw loose in his arrangements.', 'Of course it became a serious duty now, to make such a day of it, as\\nshould mark these events for a high Feast and Festival in the Peerybingle\\nCalendar for evermore.', 'Accordingly, Dot went to work to produce such an\\nentertainment, as should reflect undying honour on the house and on every\\none concerned; and in a very short space of time, she was up to her\\ndimpled elbows in flour, and whitening the Carrier’s coat, every time he\\ncame near her, by stopping him to give him a kiss.', 'That good fellow\\nwashed the greens, and peeled the turnips, and broke the plates, and\\nupset iron pots full of cold water on the fire, and made himself useful\\nin all sorts of ways: while a couple of professional assistants, hastily\\ncalled in from somewhere in the neighbourhood, as on a point of life or\\ndeath, ran against each other in all the doorways and round all the\\ncorners, and everybody tumbled over Tilly Slowboy and the Baby,\\neverywhere.', 'Tilly never came out in such force before.', 'Her ubiquity was\\nthe theme of general admiration.', 'She was a stumbling-block in the\\npassage at five-and-twenty minutes past two; a man-trap in the kitchen at\\nhalf-past two precisely; and a pitfall in the garret at five-and-twenty\\nminutes to three.', 'The Baby’s head was, as it were, a test and touchstone\\nfor every description of matter,—animal, vegetable, and mineral.', 'Nothing\\nwas in use that day that didn’t come, at some time or other, into close\\nacquaintance with it.', 'Then, there was a great Expedition set on foot to go and find out Mrs.', 'Fielding; and to be dismally penitent to that excellent gentlewoman; and\\nto bring her back, by force, if needful, to be happy and forgiving.', 'And\\nwhen the Expedition first discovered her, she would listen to no terms at\\nall, but said, an unspeakable number of times, that ever she should have\\nlived to see the day!', 'and couldn’t be got to say anything else, except,\\n‘Now carry me to the grave:’ which seemed absurd, on account of her not\\nbeing dead, or anything at all like it.', 'After a time, she lapsed into a\\nstate of dreadful calmness, and observed, that when that unfortunate\\ntrain of circumstances had occurred in the Indigo Trade, she had foreseen\\nthat she would be exposed, during her whole life, to every species of\\ninsult and contumely; and that she was glad to find it was the case; and\\nbegged they wouldn’t trouble themselves about her,—for what was she?', 'oh,\\ndear!', 'a nobody!—but would forget that such a being lived, and would take\\ntheir course in life without her.', 'From this bitterly sarcastic mood, she\\npassed into an angry one, in which she gave vent to the remarkable\\nexpression that the worm would turn if trodden on; and, after that, she\\nyielded to a soft regret, and said, if they had only given her their\\nconfidence, what might she not have had it in her power to suggest!', 'Taking advantage of this crisis in her feelings, the Expedition embraced\\nher; and she very soon had her gloves on, and was on her way to John\\nPeerybingle’s in a state of unimpeachable gentility; with a paper parcel\\nat her side containing a cap of state, almost as tall, and quite as\\nstiff, as a mitre.', 'Then, there were Dot’s father and mother to come, in another little\\nchaise; and they were behind their time; and fears were entertained; and\\nthere was much looking out for them down the road; and Mrs.', 'Fielding\\nalways would look in the wrong and morally impossible direction; and\\nbeing apprised thereof, hoped she might take the liberty of looking where\\nshe pleased.', 'At last they came: a chubby little couple, jogging along in\\na snug and comfortable little way that quite belonged to the Dot family;\\nand Dot and her mother, side by side, were wonderful to see.', 'They were\\nso like each other.', 'Then, Dot’s mother had to renew her acquaintance with May’s mother; and\\nMay’s mother always stood on her gentility; and Dot’s mother never stood\\non anything but her active little feet.', 'And old Dot—so to call Dot’s\\nfather, I forgot it wasn’t his right name, but never mind—took liberties,\\nand shook hands at first sight, and seemed to think a cap but so much\\nstarch and muslin, and didn’t defer himself at all to the Indigo Trade,\\nbut said there was no help for it now; and, in Mrs. Fielding’s summing\\nup, was a good-natured kind of man—but coarse, my dear.', 'I wouldn’t have missed Dot, doing the honours in her wedding-gown, my\\nbenison on her bright face!', 'for any money.', 'No!', 'nor the good Carrier, so\\njovial and so ruddy, at the bottom of the table.', 'Nor the brown, fresh\\nsailor-fellow, and his handsome wife.', 'Nor any one among them.', 'To have\\nmissed the dinner would have been to miss as jolly and as stout a meal as\\nman need eat; and to have missed the overflowing cups in which they drank\\nThe Wedding-Day, would have been the greatest miss of all.', 'After dinner, Caleb sang the song about the Sparkling Bowl.', 'As I’m a\\nliving man, hoping to keep so, for a year or two, he sang it through.', 'And, by-the-by, a most unlooked-for incident occurred, just as he\\nfinished the last verse.', 'There was a tap at the door; and a man came staggering in, without saying\\nwith your leave, or by your leave, with something heavy on his head.', 'Setting this down in the middle of the table, symmetrically in the centre\\nof the nuts and apples, he said:\\n\\n‘Mr.', 'Tackleton’s compliments, and as he hasn’t got no use for the cake\\nhimself, p’raps you’ll eat it.’\\n\\nAnd with those words, he walked off.', 'There was some surprise among the company, as you may imagine.', 'Mrs.', 'Fielding, being a lady of infinite discernment, suggested that the cake\\nwas poisoned, and related a narrative of a cake, which, within her\\nknowledge, had turned a seminary for young ladies, blue.', 'But she was\\noverruled by acclamation; and the cake was cut by May, with much ceremony\\nand rejoicing.', 'I don’t think any one had tasted it, when there came another tap at the\\ndoor, and the same man appeared again, having under his arm a vast\\nbrown-paper parcel.', '‘Mr.', 'Tackleton’s compliments, and he’s sent a few toys for the Babby.', 'They ain’t ugly.’\\n\\nAfter the delivery of which expressions, he retired again.', 'The whole party would have experienced great difficulty in finding words\\nfor their astonishment, even if they had had ample time to seek them.', 'But they had none at all; for the messenger had scarcely shut the door\\nbehind him, when there came another tap, and Tackleton himself walked in.', '‘Mrs.', 'Peerybingle!’ said the Toy-merchant, hat in hand.', '‘I’m sorry.', 'I’m\\nmore sorry than I was this morning.', 'I have had time to think of it.', 'John Peerybingle!', 'I’m sour by disposition; but I can’t help being\\nsweetened, more or less, by coming face to face with such a man as you.', 'Caleb!', 'This unconscious little nurse gave me a broken hint last night,\\nof which I have found the thread.', 'I blush to think how easily I might\\nhave bound you and your daughter to me, and what a miserable idiot I was,\\nwhen I took her for one!', 'Friends, one and all, my house is very lonely\\nto-night.', 'I have not so much as a Cricket on my Hearth.', 'I have scared\\nthem all away.', 'Be gracious to me; let me join this happy party!’\\n\\nHe was at home in five minutes.', 'You never saw such a fellow.', 'What _had_\\nhe been doing with himself all his life, never to have known, before, his\\ngreat capacity of being jovial!', 'Or what had the Fairies been doing with\\nhim, to have effected such a change!', '‘John!', 'you won’t send me home this evening; will you?’ whispered Dot.', 'He had been very near it though!', 'There wanted but one living creature to make the party complete; and, in\\nthe twinkling of an eye, there he was, very thirsty with hard running,\\nand engaged in hopeless endeavours to squeeze his head into a narrow\\npitcher.', 'He had gone with the cart to its journey’s end, very much\\ndisgusted with the absence of his master, and stupendously rebellious to\\nthe Deputy.', 'After lingering about the stable for some little time,\\nvainly attempting to incite the old horse to the mutinous act of\\nreturning on his own account, he had walked into the tap-room and laid\\nhimself down before the fire.', 'But suddenly yielding to the conviction\\nthat the Deputy was a humbug, and must be abandoned, he had got up again,\\nturned tail, and come home.', 'There was a dance in the evening.', 'With which general mention of that\\nrecreation, I should have left it alone, if I had not some reason to\\nsuppose that it was quite an original dance, and one of a most uncommon\\nfigure.', 'It was formed in an odd way; in this way.', 'Edward, that sailor-fellow—a good free dashing sort of a fellow he\\nwas—had been telling them various marvels concerning parrots, and mines,\\nand Mexicans, and gold dust, when all at once he took it in his head to\\njump up from his seat and propose a dance; for Bertha’s harp was there,\\nand she had such a hand upon it as you seldom hear.', 'Dot (sly little\\npiece of affectation when she chose) said her dancing days were over; _I_\\nthink because the Carrier was smoking his pipe, and she liked sitting by\\nhim, best.', 'Mrs.', 'Fielding had no choice, of course, but to say _her_\\ndancing days were over, after that; and everybody said the same, except\\nMay; May was ready.', 'So, May and Edward got up, amid great applause, to dance alone; and\\nBertha plays her liveliest tune.', 'Well!', 'if you’ll believe me, they have not been dancing five minutes, when\\nsuddenly the Carrier flings his pipe away, takes Dot round the waist,\\ndashes out into the room, and starts off with her, toe and heel, quite\\nwonderfully.', 'Tackleton no sooner sees this, than he skims across to Mrs.', 'Fielding, takes her round the waist, and follows suit.', 'Old Dot no sooner\\nsees this, than up he is, all alive, whisks off Mrs.', 'Dot in the middle of\\nthe dance, and is the foremost there.', 'Caleb no sooner sees this, than he\\nclutches Tilly Slowboy by both hands and goes off at score; Miss Slowboy,\\nfirm in the belief that diving hotly in among the other couples, and\\neffecting any number of concussions with them, is your only principle of\\nfooting it.', 'Hark!', 'how the Cricket joins the music with its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp; and\\nhow the kettle hums!', '* * * * *\\n\\nBut what is this!', 'Even as I listen to them, blithely, and turn towards\\nDot, for one last glimpse of a little figure very pleasant to me, she and\\nthe rest have vanished into air, and I am left alone.', 'A Cricket sings\\nupon the Hearth; a broken child’s-toy lies upon the ground; and nothing\\nelse remains.', '***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CRICKET ON THE

for walking.', 'In the\\nsummer I often leave home early in the morning, and roam about fields\\nand lanes all day, or even escape for days or weeks together; but,\\nsaving in the country, I seldom go out until after dark, though, Heaven\\nbe thanked, I love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the\\nearth, as much as any creature living.', 'I have fallen insensibly into this habit, both because it favours my\\ninfirmity and because it affords me greater opportunity of speculating\\non the characters and occupations of those who fill the streets.', 'The\\nglare and hurry of broad noon are not adapted to idle pursuits like\\nmine; a glimpse of passing faces caught by the light of a street-lamp\\nor a shop window is often better for my purpose than their full\\nrevelation in the daylight; and, if I must add the truth, night is\\nkinder in this respect than day, which too often destroys an air-built\\ncastle at the moment of its completion, without the least ceremony or\\nremorse.', 'That constant pacing to and fro, that never-ending restlessness, that\\nincessant tread of feet wearing the rough stones smooth and glossy--is\\nit not a wonder how the dwellers in narrows ways can bear to hear it!', 'Think of a sick man in such a place as Saint Martin’s Court, listening\\nto the footsteps, and in the midst of pain and weariness obliged,\\ndespite himself (as though it were a task he must perform) to detect\\nthe child’s step from the man’s, the slipshod beggar from the booted\\nexquisite, the lounging from the busy, the dull heel of the sauntering\\noutcast from the quick tread of an expectant pleasure-seeker--think of\\nthe hum and noise always being present to his sense, and of the stream\\nof life that will not stop, pouring on, on, on, through all his\\nrestless dreams, as if he were condemned to lie, dead but conscious, in\\na noisy churchyard, and had no hope of rest for centuries to come.', 'Then, the crowds forever passing and repassing on the bridges (on\\nthose which are free of toll at least), where many stop on fine evenings\\nlooking listlessly down upon the water with some vague idea that by and\\nby it runs between green banks which grow wider and wider until at last\\nit joins the broad vast sea--where some halt to rest from heavy loads\\nand think as they look over the parapet that to smoke and lounge away\\none’s life, and lie sleeping in the sun upon a hot tarpaulin, in a\\ndull, slow, sluggish barge, must be happiness unalloyed--and where\\nsome, and a very different class, pause with heavier loads than they,\\nremembering to have heard or read in old time that drowning was not a\\nhard death, but of all means of suicide the easiest and best.', 'Covent Garden Market at sunrise too, in the spring or summer, when the\\nfragrance of sweet flowers is in the air, over-powering even the\\nunwholesome streams of last night’s debauchery, and driving the dusky\\nthrush, whose cage has hung outside a garret window all night long,\\nhalf mad with joy!', 'Poor bird!', 'the only neighbouring thing at all akin\\nto the other little captives, some of whom, shrinking from the hot\\nhands of drunken purchasers, lie drooping on the path already, while\\nothers, soddened by close contact, await the time when they shall be\\nwatered and freshened up to please more sober company, and make old\\nclerks who pass them on their road to business, wonder what has filled\\ntheir breasts with visions of the country.', 'But my present purpose is not to expatiate upon my walks.', 'The story I\\nam about to relate, and to which I shall recur at intervals,  arose out\\nof one of these rambles; and thus I have been led to speak of them by\\nway of preface.', 'One night I had roamed into the City, and was walking slowly on in my\\nusual way, musing upon a great many things, when I was arrested by an\\ninquiry, the purport of which did not reach me, but which seemed to be\\naddressed to myself, and was preferred in a soft sweet voice that\\nstruck me very pleasantly.', 'I turned hastily round and found at my elbow\\na pretty little girl, who begged to be directed to a certain street at\\na considerable distance, and indeed in quite another quarter of the\\ntown.', '‘It is a very long way from here,’ said I, ‘my child.’\\n\\n‘I know that, sir,’ she replied timidly.', '‘I am afraid it is a very long\\nway, for I came from there to-night.’\\n\\n‘Alone?’ said I, in some surprise.', '‘Oh, yes, I don’t mind that, but I am a little frightened now, for I\\nhad lost my road.’\\n\\n‘And what made you ask it of me?', 'Suppose I should tell you wrong?’\\n\\n‘I am sure you will not do that,’ said the little creature,’ you are\\nsuch a very old gentleman, and walk so slow yourself.’\\n\\nI cannot describe how much I was impressed by this appeal and the\\nenergy with which it was made, which brought a tear into the child’s\\nclear eye, and made her slight figure tremble as she looked up into my\\nface.', '‘Come,’ said I, ‘I’ll take you there.’\\n\\nShe put her hand in mine as confidingly as if she had known me from her\\ncradle, and we trudged away together; the little creature accommodating\\nher pace to mine, and rather seeming to lead and take care of me than I\\nto be protecting her.', 'I observed that every now and then she stole a\\ncurious look at my face, as if to make quite sure that I was not\\ndeceiving her, and that these glances (very sharp and keen they were\\ntoo) seemed to increase her confidence at every repetition.', 'For my part, my curiosity and interest were at least equal to the\\nchild’s, for child she certainly was, although I thought it probably\\nfrom what I could make out, that her very small and delicate frame\\nimparted a peculiar youthfulness to her appearance.', 'Though more\\nscantily attired than she might have been she was dressed with perfect\\nneatness, and betrayed no marks of poverty or neglect.', '‘Who has sent you so far by yourself?’ said I.', '‘Someone who is very kind to me, sir.’\\n\\n‘And what have you been doing?’\\n\\n‘That, I must not tell,’ said the child firmly.', 'There was something in the manner of this reply which caused me to look\\nat the little creature with an involuntary expression of surprise; for\\nI wondered what kind of errand it might be that occasioned her to be\\nprepared for questioning.', 'Her quick eye seemed to read my thoughts, for\\nas it met mine she added that there was no harm in what she had been\\ndoing, but it was a great secret--a secret which she did not even know\\nherself.', 'This was said with no appearance of cunning or deceit, but with an\\nunsuspicious frankness that bore the impress of truth.', 'She walked on as\\nbefore, growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking\\ncheerfully by the way, but she said no more about her home, beyond\\nremarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a\\nshort one.', 'While we were thus engaged, I revolved in my mind a hundred different\\nexplanations of the riddle and rejected them every one.', 'I really felt\\nashamed to take advantage of the ingenuousness or grateful feeling of\\nthe child for the purpose of gratifying my curiosity.', 'I love these\\nlittle people; and it is not a slight thing when they, who are so fresh\\nfrom God, love us.', 'As I had felt pleased at first by her confidence I\\ndetermined to deserve it, and to do credit to the nature which had\\nprompted her to repose it in me.', 'There was no reason, however, why I should refrain from seeing the\\nperson who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night\\nand alone, and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near\\nhome she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity, I\\navoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate, and thus\\nit was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we\\nwere.', 'Clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a\\nshort distance, my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining\\non the step till I came up knocked at it when I joined her.', 'A part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter, which I\\ndid not observe at first, for all was very dark and silent within, and\\nI was anxious (as indeed the child was also) for an answer to our\\nsummons.', 'When she had knocked twice or thrice there was a noise as if\\nsome person were moving inside, and at length a faint light appeared\\nthrough the glass which, as it approached very slowly, the bearer\\nhaving to make his way through a great many scattered articles, enabled\\nme to see both what kind of person it was who advanced and what kind of\\nplace it was through which he came.', 'It was an old man with long grey hair, whose face and figure as he held\\nthe light above his head and looked before him as he approached, I\\ncould plainly see.', 'Though much altered by age, I fancied I could\\nrecognize in his spare and slender form something of that delicate\\nmould which I had noticed in the child.', 'Their bright blue eyes were\\ncertainly alike, but his face was so deeply furrowed and so very full\\nof care, that here all resemblance ceased.', 'The place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those\\nreceptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd\\ncorners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public\\neye in jealousy and distrust.', 'There were suits of mail standing like\\nghosts in armour here and there, fantastic carvings brought from\\nmonkish cloisters, rusty weapons of various kinds, distorted figures in\\nchina and wood and iron and ivory: tapestry and strange furniture that\\nmight have been designed in dreams.', 'The haggard aspect of the little\\nold man was wonderfully suited to the place; he might have groped among\\nold churches and tombs and deserted houses and gathered all the spoils\\nwith his own hands.', 'There was nothing in the whole collection but was\\nin keeping with himself nothing that looked older or more worn than he.', 'As he turned the key in the lock, he surveyed me with some astonishment\\nwhich was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion.', 'The\\ndoor being opened, the child addressed him as grandfather, and told him\\nthe little story of our companionship.', '‘Why, bless thee, child,’ said the old man, patting her on the head,\\n‘how couldst thou miss thy way?', 'What if I had lost thee, Nell!’\\n\\n‘I would have found my way back to YOU, grandfather,’ said the child\\nboldly; ‘never fear.’\\n\\nThe old man kissed her, then turning to me and begging me to walk in, I\\ndid so.', 'The door was closed and locked.', 'Preceding me with the light, he\\nled me through the place I had already seen from without, into a small\\nsitting-room behind, in which was another door opening into a kind of\\ncloset, where I saw a little bed that a fairy might have slept in, it\\nlooked so very small and was so prettily arranged.', 'The child took a\\ncandle and tripped into this little room, leaving the old man and me\\ntogether.', '‘You must be tired, sir,’ said he as he placed a chair near the fire,\\n‘how can I thank you?’\\n\\n‘By taking more care of your grandchild another time, my good friend,’\\nI replied.', '‘More care!’ said the old man in a shrill voice, ‘more care of Nelly!', 'Why, who ever loved a child as I love Nell?’\\n\\nHe said this with such evident surprise that I was perplexed what\\nanswer to make, and the more so because coupled with something feeble\\nand wandering in his manner, there were in his face marks of deep and\\nanxious thought which convinced me that he could not be, as I had been\\nat first inclined to suppose, in a state of dotage or imbecility.', '‘I don’t think you consider--’ I began.', '‘I don’t consider!’ cried the old man interrupting me, ‘I don’t\\nconsider her!', 'Ah, how little you know of the truth!', 'Little Nelly,\\nlittle Nelly!’\\n\\nIt would be impossible for any man, I care not what his form of speech\\nmight be, to express more affection than the dealer in curiosities did,\\nin these four words.', 'I waited for him to speak again, but he rested his\\nchin upon his hand and shaking his head twice or thrice fixed his eyes\\nupon the fire.', 'While we were sitting thus in silence, the door of the closet opened,\\nand the child returned, her light brown hair hanging loose about her\\nneck, and her face flushed with the haste she had made to rejoin us.', 'She busied herself immediately in preparing supper, and while she was\\nthus engaged I remarked that the old man took an opportunity of\\nobserving me more closely than he had done yet.', 'I was surprised to see\\nthat all this time everything was done by the child, and that there\\nappeared to be no other persons but ourselves in the house.', 'I took\\nadvantage of a moment when she was absent to venture a hint on this\\npoint, to which the old man replied that there were few grown persons\\nas trustworthy or as careful as she.', '‘It always grieves me,’ I observed, roused by what I took to be his\\nselfishness, ‘it always grieves me to contemplate the initiation of\\nchildren into the ways of life, when they are scarcely more than\\ninfants.', 'It checks their confidence and simplicity--two of the best\\nqualities that Heaven gives them--and demands that they share our\\nsorrows before they are capable of entering into our enjoyments.’\\n\\n‘It will never check hers,’ said the old man looking steadily at me,\\n‘the springs are too deep.', 'Besides, the children of the poor know but\\nfew pleasures.', 'Even the cheap delights of childhood must be bought and\\npaid for.’\\n\\n‘But--forgive me for saying this--you are surely not so very\\npoor’--said I.', '‘She is not my child, sir,’ returned the old man.', '‘Her mother was, and\\nshe was poor.', 'I save nothing--not a penny--though I live as you see,\\nbut’--he laid his hand upon my arm and leant forward to whisper--‘she\\nshall be rich one of these days, and a fine lady.', 'Don’t you think ill\\nof me because I use her help.', 'She gives it cheerfully as you see, and\\nit would break her heart if she knew that I suffered anybody else to do\\nfor me what her little hands could undertake.', 'I don’t consider!’--he\\ncried with sudden querulousness, ‘why, God knows that this one child is\\nthe thought and object of my life, and yet he never prospers me--no,\\nnever!’\\n\\nAt this juncture, the subject of our conversation again returned, and\\nthe old man motioning to me to approach the table, broke off, and said\\nno more.', 'We had scarcely begun our repast when there was a knock at the door by\\nwhich I had entered, and Nell bursting into a hearty laugh, which I was\\nrejoiced to hear, for it was childlike and full of hilarity, said it\\nwas no doubt dear old Kit coming back at last.', '‘Foolish Nell!’ said the old man fondling with her hair.', '‘She always\\nlaughs at poor Kit.’\\n\\nThe child laughed again more heartily than before, and I could not help\\nsmiling from pure sympathy.', 'The little old man took up a candle and\\nwent to open the door.', 'When he came back, Kit was at his heels.', 'Kit was a shock-headed, shambling, awkward lad with an uncommonly wide\\nmouth, very red cheeks, a turned-up nose, and certainly the most\\ncomical expression of face I ever saw.', 'He stopped short at the door on\\nseeing a stranger, twirled in his hand a perfectly round old hat\\nwithout any vestige of a brim, and resting himself now on one leg and\\nnow on the other and changing them constantly, stood in the doorway,\\nlooking into the parlour with the most extraordinary leer I ever\\nbeheld.', 'I entertained a grateful feeling towards the boy from that\\nminute, for I felt that he was the comedy of the child’s life.', '‘A long way, wasn’t it, Kit?’ said the little old man.', '‘Why, then, it was a goodish stretch, master,’ returned Kit.', '‘Of course you have come back hungry?’\\n\\n‘Why, then, I do consider myself rather so, master,’ was the answer.', 'The lad had a remarkable manner of standing sideways as he spoke, and\\nthrusting his head forward over his shoulder, as if he could not get at\\nhis voice without that accompanying action.', 'I think he would have\\namused one anywhere, but the child’s exquisite enjoyment of his oddity,\\nand the relief it was to find that there was something she associated\\nwith merriment in a place that appeared so unsuited to her, were quite\\nirresistible.', 'It was a great point too that Kit himself was flattered\\nby the sensation he created, and after several efforts to preserve his\\ngravity, burst into a loud roar, and so stood with his mouth wide open\\nand his eyes nearly shut, laughing violently.', 'The old man had again relapsed into his former abstraction and took no\\nnotice of what passed, but I remarked that when her laugh was over, the\\nchild’s bright eyes were dimmed with tears, called forth by the\\nfullness of heart with which she welcomed her uncouth favourite after\\nthe little anxiety of the night.', 'As for Kit himself (whose laugh had\\nbeen all the time one of that sort which very little would change into\\na cry) he carried a large slice of bread and meat and a mug of beer\\ninto a corner, and applied himself to disposing of them with great\\nvoracity.', '‘Ah!’ said the old man turning to me with a sigh, as if I had spoken to\\nhim but that moment, ‘you don’t know what you say when you tell me that\\nI don’t consider her.’\\n\\n‘You must not attach too great weight to a remark founded on first\\nappearances, my friend,’ said I.', '‘No,’ returned the old man thoughtfully, ‘no.', 'Come hither, Nell.’\\n\\nThe little girl hastened from her seat, and put her arm about his neck.', '‘Do I love thee, Nell?’ said he.', '‘Say--do I love thee, Nell, or no?’\\n\\nThe child only answered by her caresses, and laid her head upon his\\nbreast.', '‘Why dost thou sob?’ said the grandfather, pressing her closer to him\\nand glancing towards me.', '‘Is it because thou know’st I love thee, and\\ndost not like that I should seem to doubt it by my question?', 'Well,\\nwell--then let us say I love thee dearly.’\\n\\n‘Indeed, indeed you do,’ replied the child with great earnestness, ‘Kit\\nknows you do.’\\n\\nKit, who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing\\ntwo-thirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a\\njuggler, stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to, and\\nbawled ‘Nobody isn’t such a fool as to say he doosn’t,’ after which he\\nincapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most\\nprodigious sandwich at one bite.', '‘She is poor now’--said the old man, patting the child’s cheek, ‘but I\\nsay again that the time is coming when she shall be rich.', 'It has been a\\nlong time coming, but it must come at last; a very long time, but it\\nsurely must come.', 'It has come to other men who do nothing but waste and\\nriot.', 'When WILL it come to me!’\\n\\n‘I am very happy as I am, grandfather,’ said the child.', '‘Tush, tush!’ returned the old man, ‘thou dost not know--how should’st\\nthou!’ then he muttered again between his teeth, ‘The time must come, I\\nam very sure it must.', 'It will be all the better for coming late’; and\\nthen he sighed and fell into his former musing state, and still holding\\nthe child between his knees appeared to be insensible to everything\\naround him.', 'By this time it wanted but a few minutes of midnight and I\\nrose to go, which recalled him to himself.', '‘One moment, sir,’ he said, ‘Now, Kit--near midnight, boy, and you\\nstill here!', 'Get home, get home, and be true to your time in the\\nmorning, for there’s work to do.', 'Good night!', 'There, bid him good night,\\nNell, and let him be gone!’\\n\\n‘Good night, Kit,’ said the child, her eyes lighting up with merriment\\nand kindness.', '‘Good night, Miss Nell,’ returned the boy.', '‘And thank this gentleman,’ interposed the old man, ‘but for whose care\\nI might have lost my little girl to-night.’\\n\\n‘No, no, master,’ said Kit, ‘that won’t do, that won’t.’\\n\\n‘What do you mean?’ cried the old man.', '‘I’d have found her, master,’ said Kit, ‘I’d have found her.', 'I’ll bet\\nthat I’d find her if she was above ground, I would, as quick as\\nanybody, master.', 'Ha, ha, ha!’\\n\\nOnce more opening his mouth and shutting his eyes, and laughing like a\\nstentor, Kit gradually backed to the door, and roared himself out.', 'Free of the room, the boy was not slow in taking his departure; when he\\nhad gone, and the child was occupied in clearing the table, the old man\\nsaid:\\n\\n‘I haven’t seemed to thank you, sir, for what you have done to-night,\\nbut I do thank you humbly and heartily, and so does she, and her thanks\\nare better worth than mine.', 'I should be sorry that you went away, and\\nthought I was unmindful of your goodness, or careless of her--I am not\\nindeed.’\\n\\nI was sure of that, I said, from what I had seen.', '‘But,’ I added, ‘may\\nI ask you a question?’\\n\\n‘Ay, sir,’ replied the old man, ‘What is it?’\\n\\n‘This delicate child,’ said I, ‘with so much beauty and\\nintelligence--has she nobody to care for her but you?', 'Has she no other\\ncompanion or advisor?’\\n\\n‘No,’ he returned, looking anxiously in my face, ‘no, and she wants no\\nother.’\\n\\n‘But are you not fearful,’ said I, ‘that you may misunderstand a charge\\nso tender?', 'I am sure you mean well, but are you quite certain that you\\nknow how to execute such a trust as this?', 'I am an old man, like you,\\nand I am actuated by an old man’s concern in all that is young and\\npromising.', 'Do you not think that what I have seen of you and this\\nlittle creature to-night must have an interest not wholly free from\\npain?’\\n\\n‘Sir,’ rejoined the old man after a moment’s silence.', '‘I have no right\\nto feel hurt at what you say.', 'It is true that in many respects I am the\\nchild, and she the grown person--that you have seen already.', 'But waking\\nor sleeping, by night or day, in sickness or health, she is the one\\nobject of my care, and if you knew of how much care, you would look on\\nme with different eyes, you would indeed.', 'Ah!', 'It’s a weary life for an\\nold man--a weary, weary life--but there is a great end to gain and that\\nI keep before me.’\\n\\nSeeing that he was in a state of excitement and impatience, I turned to\\nput on an outer coat which I had thrown off on entering the room,\\npurposing to say no more.', 'I was surprised to see the child standing\\npatiently by with a cloak upon her arm, and in her hand a hat, and\\nstick.', '‘Those are not mine, my dear,’ said I.', '‘No,’ returned the child, ‘they are grandfather’s.’\\n\\n‘But he is not going out to-night.’\\n\\n‘Oh, yes, he is,’ said the child, with a smile.', '‘And what becomes of you, my pretty one?’\\n\\n‘Me!', 'I stay here of course.', 'I always do.’\\n\\nI looked in astonishment towards the old man, but he was, or feigned to\\nbe, busied in the arrangement of his dress.', 'From him I looked back to\\nthe slight gentle figure of the child.', 'Alone!', 'In that gloomy place all\\nthe long, dreary night.', 'She evinced no consciousness of my surprise, but cheerfully helped the\\nold man with his cloak, and when he was ready took a candle to light us\\nout.', 'Finding that we did not follow as she expected, she looked back\\nwith a smile and waited for us.', 'The old man showed by his face that he\\nplainly understood the cause of my hesitation, but he merely signed to\\nme with an inclination of the head to pass out of the room before him,\\nand remained silent.', 'I had no resource but to comply.', 'When we reached the door, the child setting down the candle, turned to\\nsay good night and raised her face to kiss me.', 'Then she ran to the old\\nman, who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her.', '‘Sleep soundly, Nell,’ he said in a low voice, ‘and angels guard thy\\nbed!', 'Do not forget thy prayers, my sweet.’\\n\\n‘No, indeed,’ answered the child fervently, ‘they make me feel so\\nhappy!’\\n\\n‘That’s well; I know they do; they should,’ said the old man.', '‘Bless\\nthee a hundred times!', 'Early in the morning I shall be home.’\\n\\n‘You’ll not ring twice,’ returned the child.', '‘The bell wakes me, even\\nin the middle of a dream.’\\n\\nWith this, they separated.', 'The child opened the door (now guarded by a\\nshutter which I had heard the boy put up before he left the house) and\\nwith another farewell whose clear and tender note I have recalled a\\nthousand times, held it until we had passed out.', 'The old man paused a\\nmoment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside, and\\nsatisfied that this was done, walked on at a slow pace.', 'At the\\nstreet-corner he stopped, and regarding me with a troubled countenance\\nsaid that our ways were widely different and that he must take his\\nleave.', 'I would have spoken, but summoning up more alacrity than might\\nhave been expected in one of his appearance, he hurried away.', 'I could\\nsee that twice or thrice he looked back as if to ascertain if I were\\nstill watching him, or perhaps to assure himself that I was not\\nfollowing at a distance.', 'The obscurity of the night favoured his\\ndisappearance, and his figure was soon beyond my sight.', 'I remained standing on the spot where he had left me, unwilling to\\ndepart, and yet unknowing why I should loiter there.', 'I looked wistfully\\ninto the street we had lately quitted, and after a time directed my\\nsteps that way.', 'I passed and repassed the house, and stopped and\\nlistened at the door; all was dark, and silent as the grave.', 'Yet I lingered about, and could not tear myself away, thinking of all\\npossible harm that might happen to the child--of fires and robberies\\nand even murder--and feeling as if some evil must ensue if I turned my\\nback upon the place.', 'The closing of a door or window in the street\\nbrought me before the curiosity-dealer’s once more; I crossed the road\\nand looked up at the house to assure myself that the noise had not come\\nfrom there.', 'No, it was black, cold, and lifeless as before.', 'There were few passengers astir; the street was sad and dismal, and\\npretty well my own.', 'A few stragglers from the theatres hurried by, and\\nnow and then I turned aside to avoid some noisy drunkard as he reeled\\nhomewards, but these interruptions were not frequent and soon ceased.', 'The clocks struck one.', 'Still I paced up and down, promising myself that\\nevery time should be the last, and breaking faith with myself on some\\nnew plea as often as I did so.', 'The more I thought of what the old man had said, and of his looks and\\nbearing, the less I could account for what I had seen and heard.', 'I had\\na strong misgiving that his nightly absence was for no good purpose.', 'I\\nhad only come to know the fact through the innocence of the child, and\\nthough the old man was by at the time, and saw my undisguised surprise,\\nhe had preserved a strange mystery upon the subject and offered no word\\nof explanation.', 'These reflections naturally recalled again more\\nstrongly than before his haggard face, his wandering manner, his\\nrestless anxious looks.', 'His affection for the child might not be\\ninconsistent with villany of the worst kind; even that very affection\\nwas in itself an extraordinary contradiction, or how could he leave her\\nthus?', 'Disposed as I was to think badly of him, I never doubted that his\\nlove for her was real.', 'I could not admit the thought, remembering what\\nhad passed between us, and the tone of voice in which he had called her\\nby her name.', '‘Stay here of course,’ the child had said in answer to my question, ‘I\\nalways do!’ What could take him from home by night, and every night!', 'I\\ncalled up all the strange tales I had ever heard of dark and secret\\ndeeds committed in great towns and escaping detection for a long series\\nof years; wild as many of these stories were, I could not find one\\nadapted to this mystery, which only became the more impenetrable, in\\nproportion as I sought to solve it.', 'Occupied with such thoughts as these, and a crowd of others all tending\\nto the same point, I continued to pace the street for two long hours;\\nat length the rain began to descend heavily, and then over-powered by\\nfatigue though no less interested than I had been at first, I engaged\\nthe nearest coach and so got home.', 'A cheerful fire was blazing on the\\nhearth, the lamp burnt brightly, my clock received me with its old\\nfamiliar welcome; everything was quiet, warm and cheering, and in happy\\ncontrast to the gloom and darkness I had quitted.', 'But all that night, waking or in my sleep, the same thoughts recurred\\nand the same images retained possession of my brain.', 'I had ever before\\nme the old dark murky rooms--the gaunt suits of mail with their ghostly\\nsilent air--the faces all awry, grinning from wood and stone--the dust\\nand rust and worm that lives in wood--and alone in the midst of all\\nthis lumber and decay and ugly age, the beautiful child in her gentle\\nslumber, smiling through her light and sunny dreams.', 'CHAPTER 2\\n\\nAfter combating, for nearly a week, the feeling which impelled me to\\nrevisit the place I had quitted under the circumstances already\\ndetailed, I yielded to it at length; and determining that this time I\\nwould present myself by the light of day, bent my steps thither early\\nin the morning.', 'I walked past the house, and took several turns in the street, with\\nthat kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that\\nthe visit he is about to pay is unexpected, and may not be very\\nacceptable.', 'However, as the door of the shop was shut, and it did not\\nappear likely that I should be recognized by those within, if I\\ncontinued merely to pass up and down before it, I soon conquered this\\nirresolution, and found myself in the Curiosity Dealer’s warehouse.', 'The old man and another person were together in the back part, and\\nthere seemed to have been high words between them, for their voices\\nwhich were raised to a very high pitch suddenly stopped on my entering,\\nand the old man advancing hastily towards me, said in a tremulous tone\\nthat he was very glad I had come.', '‘You interrupted us at a critical moment,’ said he, pointing to the man\\nwhom I had found in company with him; ‘this fellow will murder me one\\nof these days.', 'He would have done so, long ago, if he had dared.’\\n\\n‘Bah!', 'You would swear away my life if you could,’ returned the other,\\nafter bestowing a stare and a frown on me; ‘we all know that!’\\n\\n‘I almost think I could,’ cried the old man, turning feebly upon him.', '‘If oaths, or prayers, or words, could rid me of you, they should.', 'I\\nwould be quit of you, and would be relieved if you were dead.’\\n\\n‘I know it,’ returned the other.', '‘I said so, didn’t I?', 'But neither\\noaths, or prayers, nor words, WILL kill me, and therefore I live, and\\nmean to live.’\\n\\n‘And his mother died!’ cried the old man, passionately clasping his\\nhands and looking upward; ‘and this is Heaven’s justice!’\\n\\nThe other stood lounging with his foot upon a chair, and regarded him\\nwith a contemptuous sneer.', 'He was a young man of one-and-twenty or\\nthereabouts; well made, and certainly handsome, though the expression\\nof his face was far from prepossessing, having in common with his\\nmanner and even his dress, a dissipated, insolent air which repelled\\none.', '‘Justice or no justice,’ said the young fellow, ‘here I am and here I\\nshall stop till such time as I think fit to go, unless you send for\\nassistance to put me out--which you won’t do, I know.', 'I tell you again\\nthat I want to see my sister.’\\n\\n‘YOUR sister!’ said the old man bitterly.', '‘Ah!', 'You can’t change the relationship,’ returned the other.', '‘If you\\ncould, you’d have done it long ago.', 'I want to see my sister, that you\\nkeep cooped up here, poisoning her mind with your sly secrets and\\npretending an affection for her that you may work her to death, and add\\na few scraped shillings every week to the money you can hardly count.', 'I\\nwant to see her; and I will.’\\n\\n‘Here’s a moralist to talk of poisoned minds!', 'Here’s a generous spirit\\nto scorn scraped-up shillings!’ cried the old man, turning from him to\\nme.', '‘A profligate, sir, who has forfeited every claim not only upon\\nthose who have the misfortune to be of his blood, but upon society\\nwhich knows nothing of him but his misdeeds.', 'A liar too,’ he added, in\\na lower voice as he drew closer to me, ‘who knows how dear she is to\\nme, and seeks to wound me even there, because there is a stranger\\nnearby.’\\n\\n‘Strangers are nothing to me, grandfather,’ said the young fellow\\ncatching at the word, ‘nor I to them, I hope.', 'The best they can do, is\\nto keep an eye to their business and leave me to mine.', 'There’s a friend\\nof mine waiting outside, and as it seems that I may have to wait some\\ntime, I’ll call him in, with your leave.’\\n\\nSaying this, he stepped to the door, and looking down the street\\nbeckoned several times to some unseen person, who, to judge from the\\nair of impatience with which these signals were accompanied, required a\\ngreat quantity of persuasion to induce him to advance.', 'At length there\\nsauntered up, on the opposite side of the way--with a bad pretense of\\npassing by accident--a figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness,\\nwhich after a great many frowns and jerks of the head, in resistance of\\nthe invitation, ultimately crossed the road and was brought into the\\nshop.', '‘There.', 'It’s Dick Swiveller,’ said the young fellow, pushing him in.', '‘Sit down, Swiveller.’\\n\\n‘But is the old min agreeable?’ said Mr Swiveller in an undertone.', 'Mr Swiveller complied, and looking about him with a propitiatory smile,\\nobserved that last week was a fine week for the ducks, and this week\\nwas a fine week for the dust; he also observed that whilst standing by\\nthe post at the street-corner, he had observed a pig with a straw in\\nhis mouth issuing out of the tobacco-shop, from which appearance he\\naugured that another fine week for the ducks was approaching, and that\\nrain would certainly ensue.', 'He furthermore took occasion to apologize\\nfor any negligence that might be perceptible in his dress, on the\\nground that last night he had had ‘the sun very strong in his eyes’; by\\nwhich expression he was understood to convey to his hearers in the most\\ndelicate manner possible, the information that he had been extremely\\ndrunk.', '‘But what,’ said Mr Swiveller with a sigh, ‘what is the odds so long as\\nthe fire of soul is kindled at the taper of conwiviality, and the wing\\nof friendship never moults a feather!', 'What is the odds so long as the\\nspirit is expanded by means of rosy wine, and the present moment is the\\nleast happiest of our existence!’\\n\\n‘You needn’t act the chairman here,’ said his friend, half aside.', '‘Fred!’ cried Mr Swiveller, tapping his nose, ‘a word to the wise is\\nsufficient for them--we may be good and happy without riches, Fred.', 'Say not another syllable.', 'I know my cue; smart is the word.', 'Only one\\nlittle whisper, Fred--is the old min friendly?’\\n\\n‘Never you mind,’ replied his friend.', '‘Right again, quite right,’ said Mr Swiveller, ‘caution is the word,\\nand caution is the act.’ with that, he winked as if in preservation of\\nsome deep secret, and folding his arms and leaning back in his chair,\\nlooked up at the ceiling with profound gravity.', 'It was perhaps not very unreasonable to suspect from what had already\\npassed, that Mr Swiveller was not quite recovered from the effects of\\nthe powerful sunlight to which he had made allusion; but if no such\\nsuspicion had been awakened by his speech, his wiry hair, dull eyes,\\nand sallow face would still have been strong witnesses against him.', 'His\\nattire was not, as he had himself hinted, remarkable for the  nicest\\narrangement, but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced the\\nidea that he had gone to bed in it.', 'It consisted of a brown body-coat\\nwith a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind, a\\nbright check neckerchief, a plaid waistcoat, soiled white trousers, and\\na very limp hat, worn with the wrong side foremost, to hide a hole in\\nthe brim.', 'The breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket\\nfrom which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very\\nill-favoured handkerchief; his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far\\nas possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs; he displayed\\nno gloves, and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with\\nthe semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its\\ngrasp.', 'With all these personal advantages (to which may be added a\\nstrong savour of tobacco-smoke, and a prevailing greasiness of\\nappearance) Mr Swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on\\nthe ceiling, and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key,\\nobliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air, and\\nthen, in the middle of a note, relapsed into his former silence.', 'The old man sat himself down in a chair, and with folded hands, looked\\nsometimes at his grandson and sometimes at his strange companion, as if\\nhe were utterly powerless and had no resource but to leave them to do\\nas they pleased.', 'The young man reclined against a table at no great\\ndistance from his friend, in apparent indifference to everything that\\nhad passed; and I--who felt the difficulty of any interference,\\nnotwithstanding that the old man had appealed to me, both by words and\\nlooks--made the best feint I could of being occupied in examining some\\nof the goods that were disposed for sale, and paying very little\\nattention to a person before me.', 'The silence was not of long duration, for Mr Swiveller, after favouring\\nus with several melodious assurances that his heart was in the\\nHighlands, and that he wanted but his Arab steed as a preliminary to\\nthe achievement of great feats of valour and loyalty, removed his eyes\\nfrom the ceiling and subsided into prose again.', '‘Fred,’ said Mr Swiveller stopping short, as if the idea had suddenly\\noccurred to him, and speaking in the same audible whisper as before,\\n‘is the old min friendly?’\\n\\n‘What does it matter?’ returned his friend peevishly.', '‘No, but IS he?’ said Dick.', '‘Yes, of course.', 'What do I care whether he is or not?’\\n\\nEmboldened as it seemed by this reply to enter into a more general\\nconversation, Mr Swiveller plainly laid himself out to captivate our\\nattention.', 'He began by remarking that soda-water, though a good thing in the\\nabstract, was apt to lie cold upon the stomach unless qualified with\\nginger, or a small infusion of brandy, which latter article he held to\\nbe preferable in all cases, saving for the one consideration of\\nexpense.', 'Nobody venturing to dispute these positions, he proceeded to\\nobserve that the human hair was a great retainer of tobacco-smoke, and\\nthat the young gentlemen of Westminster and Eton, after eating vast\\nquantities of apples to conceal any scent of cigars from their anxious\\nfriends, were usually detected in consequence of their heads possessing\\nthis remarkable property; when he concluded that if the Royal Society\\nwould turn their attention to the circumstance, and endeavour to find\\nin the resources of science a means of preventing such untoward\\nrevelations, they might indeed be looked upon as benefactors to\\nmankind.', 'These opinions being equally incontrovertible with those he\\nhad already pronounced, he went on to inform us that Jamaica rum,\\nthough unquestionably an agreeable spirit of great richness and\\nflavour, had the drawback of remaining constantly present to the taste\\nnext day; and nobody being venturous enough to argue this point either,\\nhe increased in confidence and became yet more companionable and\\ncommunicative.', '‘It’s a devil of a thing, gentlemen,’ said Mr Swiveller, ‘when\\nrelations fall out and disagree.', 'If the wing of friendship should never\\nmoult a feather, the wing of relationship should never be clipped, but\\nbe always expanded and serene.', 'Why should a grandson and grandfather\\npeg away at each other with mutual wiolence when all might be bliss and\\nconcord.', 'Why not jine hands and forgit it?’\\n\\n‘Hold your tongue,’ said his friend.', '‘Sir,’ replied Mr Swiveller, ‘don’t you interrupt the chair.', 'Gentlemen, how does the case stand, upon the present occasion?', 'Here is\\na jolly old grandfather--I say it with the utmost respect--and here is\\na wild, young grandson.', 'The jolly old grandfather says to the wild\\nyoung grandson, “I have brought you up and educated you, Fred; I have\\nput you in the way of getting on in life; you have bolted a little out\\nof course, as young fellows often do; and you shall never have another\\nchance, nor the ghost of half a one.”  The wild young grandson makes\\nanswer to this and says, “You’re as rich as rich can be; you have been\\nat no uncommon expense on my account, you’re saving up piles of money\\nfor my little sister that lives with you in a secret, stealthy,\\nhugger-muggering kind of way and with no manner of enjoyment--why can’t\\nyou stand a trifle for your grown-up relation?” The jolly old\\ngrandfather unto this, retorts, not only that he declines to fork out\\nwith that cheerful readiness which is always so agreeable and pleasant\\nin a gentleman of his time of life, but that he will bow up, and call\\nnames, and make reflections whenever they meet.', 'Then the plain question\\nis, an’t it a pity that this state of things should continue, and how\\nmuch better would it be for the gentleman to hand over a reasonable\\namount of tin, and make it all right and comfortable?’\\n\\nHaving delivered this oration with a great many waves and flourishes of\\nthe hand, Mr Swiveller abruptly thrust the head of his cane into his\\nmouth as if to prevent himself from impairing the effect of his speech\\nby adding one other word.', '‘Why do you hunt and persecute me, God help me!’ said the old man\\nturning to his grandson.', '‘Why do you bring your prolifigate companions\\nhere?', 'How often am I to tell you that my life is one of care and\\nself-denial, and that I am poor?’\\n\\n‘How often am I to tell you,’ returned the other, looking coldly at\\nhim, ‘that I know better?’\\n\\n‘You have chosen your own path,’ said the old man.', '‘Follow it.', 'Leave\\nNell and me to toil and work.’\\n\\n‘Nell will be a woman soon,’ returned the other, ‘and, bred in your\\nfaith, she’ll forget her brother unless he shows himself sometimes.’\\n\\n‘Take care,’ said the old man with sparkling eyes, ‘that she does not\\nforget you when you would have her memory keenest.', 'Take care that the\\nday don’t come when you walk barefoot in the streets, and she rides by\\nin a gay carriage of her own.’\\n\\n‘You mean when she has your money?’ retorted the other.', '‘How like a\\npoor man he talks!’\\n\\n‘And yet,’ said the old man dropping his voice and speaking like one\\nwho thinks aloud, ‘how poor we are, and what a life it is!', 'The cause is\\na young child’s guiltless of all harm or wrong, but nothing goes well\\nwith it!', 'Hope and patience, hope and patience!’\\n\\nThese words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the\\nyoung men.', 'Mr Swiveller appeared to think that they implied some mental\\nstruggle consequent upon the powerful effect of his address, for he\\npoked his friend with his cane and whispered his conviction that he had\\nadministered ‘a clincher,’ and that he expected a commission on the\\nprofits.', 'Discovering his mistake after a while, he appeared to grow\\nrather sleepy and discontented, and had more than once suggested the\\npropriety of an immediate departure, when the door opened, and the\\nchild herself appeared.', 'CHAPTER 3\\n\\nThe child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard\\nfeatures and forbidding aspect, and so low in stature as to be quite a\\ndwarf, though his head and face were large enough for the body of a\\ngiant.', 'His black eyes were restless, sly, and cunning; his mouth and\\nchin, bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard; and his\\ncomplexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome.', 'But what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a\\nghastly smile, which, appearing to be the mere result of habit and to\\nhave no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling, constantly\\nrevealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his\\nmouth, and gave him the aspect of a panting dog.', 'His dress consisted of\\na large high-crowned hat, a worn dark suit, a pair of capacious shoes,\\nand a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to\\ndisclose the greater portion of his wiry throat.', 'Such hair as he had\\nwas of a grizzled black, cut short and straight upon his temples, and\\nhanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears.', 'His hands, which were of a\\nrough, coarse grain, were very dirty; his fingernails were crooked,\\nlong, and yellow.', 'There was ample time to note these particulars, for besides that they\\nwere sufficiently obvious without very close observation, some moments\\nelapsed before any one broke silence.', 'The child advanced timidly\\ntowards her brother and put her hand in his, the dwarf (if we may call\\nhim so) glanced keenly at all present, and the curiosity-dealer, who\\nplainly had not expected his uncouth visitor, seemed disconcerted and\\nembarrassed.', '‘Ah!’ said the dwarf, who with his hand stretched out above his eyes\\nhad been surveying the young man attentively, ‘that should be your\\ngrandson, neighbour!’\\n\\n‘Say rather that he should not be,’ replied the old man.', '‘But he is.’\\n\\n‘And that?’ said the dwarf, pointing to Dick Swiveller.', '‘Some friend of his, as welcome here as he,’ said the old man.', '‘And that?’ inquired the dwarf, wheeling round and pointing straight at\\nme.', '‘A gentleman who was so good as to bring Nell home the other night when\\nshe lost her way, coming from your house.’\\n\\nThe little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his\\nwonder, but as she was talking to the young man, held his peace, and\\nbent his head to listen.', '‘Well, Nelly,’ said the young fellow aloud.', '‘Do they teach you to hate\\nme, eh?’\\n\\n‘No, no.', 'For shame.', 'Oh, no!’ cried the child.', '‘To love me, perhaps?’ pursued her brother with a sneer.', '‘To do neither,’ she returned.', '‘They never speak to me about you.', 'Indeed they never do.’\\n\\n‘I dare be bound for that,’ he said, darting a bitter look at the\\ngrandfather.', '‘I dare be bound for that Nell.', 'Oh!', 'I believe you there!’\\n\\n‘But I love you dearly, Fred,’ said the child.', '‘No doubt!’\\n\\n‘I do indeed, and always will,’ the child repeated with great emotion,\\n‘but oh!', 'If you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy, then\\nI could love you more.’\\n\\n‘I see!’ said the young man, as he stooped carelessly over the child,\\nand having kissed her, pushed her from him: ‘There--get you away now\\nyou have said your lesson.', 'You needn’t whimper.', 'We part good friends\\nenough, if that’s the matter.’\\n\\nHe remained silent, following her with his eyes, until she had gained\\nher little room and closed the door; and then turning to the dwarf,\\nsaid abruptly,\\n\\n‘Harkee, Mr--’\\n\\n‘Meaning me?’ returned the dwarf.', '‘Quilp is my name.', 'You might\\nremember.', 'It’s not a long one--Daniel Quilp.’\\n\\n‘Harkee, Mr Quilp, then,’ pursued the other, ‘You have some influence\\nwith my grandfather there.’\\n\\n‘Some,’ said Mr Quilp emphatically.', '‘And are in a few of his mysteries and secrets.’\\n\\n‘A few,’ replied Quilp, with equal dryness.', '‘Then let me tell him once for all, through you, that I will come into\\nand go out of this place as often as I like, so long as he keeps Nell\\nhere; and that if he wants to be quit of me, he must first be quit of\\nher.', 'What have I done to be made a bugbear of, and to be shunned and\\ndreaded as if I brought the plague?', 'He’ll tell you that I have no\\nnatural affection; and that I care no more for Nell, for her own sake,\\nthan I do for him.', 'Let him say so.', 'I care for the whim, then, of coming\\nto and fro and reminding her of my existence.', 'I WILL see her when I\\nplease.', 'That’s my point.', 'I came here to-day to maintain it, and I’ll\\ncome here again fifty times with the same object and always with the\\nsame success.', 'I said I would stop till I had gained it.', 'I have done\\nso, and now my visit’s ended.', 'Come Dick.’\\n\\n‘Stop!’ cried Mr Swiveller, as his companion turned toward the door.', '‘Sir!’\\n\\n‘Sir, I am your humble servant,’ said Mr Quilp, to whom the\\nmonosyllable was addressed.', '‘Before I leave the gay and festive scene, and halls of dazzling light,\\nsir,’ said Mr Swiveller, ‘I will with your permission, attempt a slight\\nremark.', 'I came here, sir, this day, under the impression that the old\\nmin was friendly.’\\n\\n‘Proceed, sir,’ said Daniel Quilp; for the orator had made a sudden\\nstop.', '‘Inspired by this idea and the sentiments it awakened, sir, and feeling\\nas a mutual friend that badgering, baiting, and bullying, was not the\\nsort of thing calculated to expand the souls and promote the social\\nharmony of the contending parties, I took upon myself to suggest a\\ncourse which is THE course to be adopted to the present occasion.', 'Will\\nyou allow me to whisper half a syllable, sir?’\\n\\nWithout waiting for the permission he sought, Mr Swiveller stepped up\\nto the dwarf, and leaning on his shoulder and stooping down to get at\\nhis ear, said in a voice which was perfectly audible to all present,\\n\\n‘The watch-word to the old min is--fork.’\\n\\n‘Is what?’ demanded Quilp.', '‘Is fork, sir, fork,’ replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket.', '‘You\\nare awake, sir?’\\n\\nThe dwarf nodded.', 'Mr Swiveller drew back and nodded likewise, then drew\\na little further back and nodded again, and so on.', 'By these means he in\\ntime reached the door, where he gave a great cough to attract the\\ndwarf’s attention and gain an opportunity of expressing in dumb show,\\nthe closest confidence and most inviolable secrecy.', 'Having performed\\nthe serious pantomime that was necessary for the due conveyance of\\nthese idea, he cast himself upon his friend’s track, and vanished.', '‘Humph!’ said the dwarf with a sour look and a shrug of his shoulders,\\n‘so much for dear relations.', 'Thank God I acknowledge none!', 'Nor need you\\neither,’ he added, turning to the old man, ‘if you were not as weak as\\na reed, and nearly as senseless.’\\n\\n‘What would you have me do?’ he retorted in a kind of helpless\\ndesperation.', '‘It is easy to talk and sneer.', 'What would you have me do?’\\n\\n‘What would I do if I was in your case?’ said the dwarf.', '‘Something violent, no doubt.’\\n\\n‘You’re right there,’ returned the little man, highly gratified by the\\ncompliment, for such he evidently considered it; and grinning like a\\ndevil as he rubbed his dirty hands together.', '‘Ask Mrs Quilp, pretty Mrs\\nQuilp, obedient, timid, loving Mrs Quilp.', 'But that reminds me--I have\\nleft her all alone, and she will be anxious and know not a moment’s\\npeace till I return.', 'I know she’s always in that condition when I’m\\naway, thought she doesn’t dare to say so, unless I lead her on and tell\\nher she may speak freely and I won’t be angry with her.', 'Oh!', 'well-trained Mrs Quilp.’\\n\\nThe creature appeared quite horrible with his monstrous head and little\\nbody, as he rubbed his hands slowly round, and round, and round\\nagain--with something fantastic even in his manner of performing this\\nslight action--and, dropping his shaggy brows and cocking his chin in\\nthe air, glanced upward with a stealthy look of exultation that an imp\\nmight have copied and appropriated to himself.', '‘Here,’ he said, putting his hand into his breast and sidling up to the\\nold man as he spoke; ‘I brought it myself for fear of accidents, as,\\nbeing in gold, it was something large and heavy for Nell to carry in\\nher bag.', 'She need be accustomed to such loads betimes though,\\nneighbor, for she will carry weight when you are dead.’\\n\\n‘Heaven send she may!', 'I hope so,’ said the old man with something like\\na groan.', '‘Hope so!’ echoed the dwarf, approaching close to his ear; ‘neighbour,\\nI would I knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk.', 'But\\nyou are a deep man, and keep your secret close.’\\n\\n‘My secret!’ said the other with a haggard look.', '‘Yes, you’re\\nright--I--I--keep it close--very close.’\\n\\nHe said no more, but taking the money turned away with a slow,\\nuncertain step, and pressed his hand upon his head like a weary and\\ndejected man.', 'The dwarf watched him sharply, while he passed into the\\nlittle sitting-room and locked it in an iron safe above the\\nchimney-piece; and after musing for a short space, prepared to take his\\nleave, observing that unless he made good haste, Mrs Quilp would\\ncertainly be in fits on his return.', '‘And so, neighbour,’ he added, ‘I’ll turn my face homewards, leaving my\\nlove for Nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again, though her\\ndoing so HAS procured me an honour I didn’t expect.’ With that he bowed\\nand leered at me, and with a keen glance around which seemed to\\ncomprehend every object within his range of vision, however, small or\\ntrivial, went his way.', 'I had several times essayed to go myself, but the old man had always\\nopposed it and entreated me to remain.', 'As he renewed his entreaties on\\nour being left along, and adverted with many thanks to the former\\noccasion of our being together, I willingly yielded to his persuasions,\\nand sat down, pretending to examine some curious miniatures and a few\\nold medals which he placed before me.', 'It needed no great pressing to\\ninduce me to stay, for if my curiosity has been excited on the occasion\\nof my first visit, it certainly was not diminished now.', 'Nell joined us before long, and bringing some needle-work to the table,\\nsat by the old man’s side.', 'It was pleasant to observe the fresh flowers\\nin the room, the pet bird with a green bough shading his little cage,\\nthe breath of freshness and youth which seemed to rustle through the\\nold dull house and hover round the child.', 'It was curious, but not so\\npleasant, to turn from the beauty and grace of the girl, to the\\nstooping figure, care-worn face, and jaded aspect of the old man.', 'As\\nhe grew weaker and more feeble, what would become of this lonely little\\ncreature; poor protector as he was, say that he died--what would be her\\nfate, then?', 'The old man almost answered my thoughts, as he laid his hand on hers,\\nand spoke aloud.', '‘I’ll be of better cheer, Nell,’ he said; ‘there must be good fortune\\nin store for thee--I do not ask it for myself, but thee.', 'Such miseries\\nmust fall on thy innocent head without it, that I cannot believe but\\nthat, being tempted, it will come at last!’\\n\\nShe looked cheerfully into his face, but made no answer.', '‘When I think,’ said he, ‘of the many years--many in thy short\\nlife--that thou has lived with me; of my monotonous existence, knowing\\nno companions of thy own age nor any childish pleasures; of the\\nsolitude in which thou has grown to be what thou art, and in which thou\\nhast lived apart from nearly all thy kind but one old man; I sometimes\\nfear I have dealt hardly by thee, Nell.’\\n\\n‘Grandfather!’ cried the child in unfeigned surprise.', '‘Not in intention--no no,’ said he.', '‘I have ever looked forward to the\\ntime that should enable thee to mix among the gayest and prettiest, and\\ntake thy station with the best.', 'But I still look forward, Nell, I still\\nlook forward, and if I should be forced to leave thee, meanwhile, how\\nhave I fitted thee for struggles with the world?', 'The poor bird yonder\\nis as well qualified to encounter it, and be turned adrift upon its\\nmercies--Hark!', 'I hear Kit outside.', 'Go to him, Nell, go to him.’\\n\\nShe rose, and hurrying away, stopped, turned back, and put her arms\\nabout the old man’s neck, then left him and hurried away again--but\\nfaster this time, to hide her falling tears.', '‘A word in your ear, sir,’ said the old man in a hurried whisper.', '‘I\\nhave been rendered uneasy by what you said the other night, and can\\nonly plead that I have done all for the best--that it is too late to\\nretract, if I could (though I cannot)--and that I hope to triumph yet.', 'All is for her sake.', 'I have borne great poverty myself, and would spare\\nher the sufferings that poverty carries with it.', 'I would spare her the\\nmiseries that brought her mother, my own dear child, to an early grave.', 'I would leave her--not with resources which could be easily spent or\\nsquandered away, but with what would place her beyond the reach of want\\nfor ever.', 'You mark me sir?', 'She shall have no pittance, but a\\nfortune--Hush!', 'I can say no more than that, now or at any other time,\\nand she is here again!’\\n\\nThe eagerness with which all this was poured into my ear, the trembling\\nof the hand with which he clasped my arm, the strained and starting\\neyes he fixed upon me, the wild vehemence and agitation of his manner,\\nfilled me with amazement.', 'All that I had heard and seen, and a great\\npart of what he had said himself, led me to suppose that he was a\\nwealthy man.', 'I could form no comprehension of his character, unless he\\nwere one of those miserable wretches who, having made gain the sole end\\nand object of their lives and having succeeded in amassing great\\nriches, are constantly tortured by the dread of poverty, and beset by\\nfears of loss and ruin.', 'Many things he had said which I had been at a\\nloss to understand, were quite reconcilable with the idea thus\\npresented to me, and at length I concluded that beyond all doubt he was\\none of this unhappy race.', 'The opinion was not the result of hasty consideration, for which indeed\\nthere was no opportunity at that time, as the child came directly, and\\nsoon occupied herself in preparations for giving Kit a writing lesson,\\nof which it seemed he had a couple every week, and one regularly on\\nthat evening, to the great mirth and enjoyment both of himself and his\\ninstructress.', 'To relate how it was a long time before his modesty could\\nbe so far prevailed upon as it admit of his sitting down in the\\nparlour, in the presence of an unknown gentleman--how, when he did set\\ndown, he tucked up his sleeves and squared his elbows and put his face\\nclose to the copy-book and squinted horribly at the lines--how, from\\nthe very first moment of having the pen in his hand, he began to wallow\\nin blots, and to daub himself with ink up to the very roots of his\\nhair--how, if he did by accident form a letter properly, he immediately\\nsmeared it out again with his arm in his preparations to make\\nanother--how, at every fresh mistake, there was a fresh burst of\\nmerriment from the child and louder and not less hearty laugh from poor\\nKit himself--and how there was all the way through, notwithstanding, a\\ngentle wish on her part to teach, and an anxious desire on his to\\nlearn--to relate all these particulars would no doubt occupy more space\\nand time than they deserve.', 'It will be sufficient to say that the\\nlesson was given--that evening passed and night came on--that the old\\nman again grew restless and impatient--that he quitted the house\\nsecretly at the same hour as before--and that the child was once more\\nleft alone within its gloomy walls.', 'And now that I have carried this history so far in my own character and\\nintroduced these personages to the reader, I shall for the convenience\\nof the narrative detach myself from its further course, and leave those\\nwho have prominent and necessary parts in it to speak and act for\\nthemselves.', 'CHAPTER 4\\n\\nMr and Mrs Quilp resided on Tower Hill; and in her bower on Tower Hill\\nMrs Quilp was left to pine the absence of her lord, when he quitted her\\non the business which he had already seen to transact.', 'Mr Quilp could scarcely be said to be of any particular trade or\\ncalling, though his pursuits were diversified and his occupations\\nnumerous.', 'He collected the rents of whole colonies of filthy streets\\nand alleys by the waterside, advanced money to the seamen and petty\\nofficers of merchant vessels, had a share in the ventures of divers\\nmates of East Indiamen, smoked his smuggled cigars under the very nose\\nof the Custom House, and made appointments on ‘Change with men in\\nglazed hats and round jackets pretty well every day.', 'On the Surrey side\\nof the river was a small rat-infested dreary yard called ‘Quilp’s\\nWharf,’ in which were a little wooden counting-house burrowing all awry\\nin the dust as if it had fallen from the clouds and ploughed into the\\nground; a few fragments of rusty anchors; several large iron rings;\\nsome piles of rotten wood; and two or three heaps of old sheet copper,\\ncrumpled, cracked, and battered.', 'On Quilp’s Wharf, Daniel Quilp was a\\nship-breaker, yet to judge from these appearances he must either have\\nbeen a ship-breaker on a very small scale, or have broken his ships up\\nvery small indeed.', 'Neither did the place present any extraordinary\\naspect of life or activity, as its only human occupant was an\\namphibious boy in a canvas suit, whose sole change of occupation was\\nfrom sitting on the head of a pile and throwing stones into the mud\\nwhen the tide was out, to standing with his hands in his pockets gazing\\nlistlessly on the motion and on the bustle of the river at high-water.', 'The dwarf’s lodging on Tower hill comprised, besides the needful\\naccommodation for himself and Mrs Quilp, a small sleeping-closet for\\nthat lady’s mother, who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war\\nwith Daniel; of whom, notwithstanding, she stood in no slight dread.', 'Indeed, the ugly creature contrived by some means or other--whether by\\nhis ugliness or his ferocity or his natural cunning is no great\\nmatter--to impress with a wholesome fear of his anger, most of those\\nwith whom he was brought into daily contact and communication.', 'Over\\nnobody had he such complete ascendance as Mrs Quilp herself--a pretty\\nlittle, mild-spoken, blue-eyed woman, who having allied herself in\\nwedlock to the dwarf in one of those strange infatuations of which\\nexamples are by no means scarce, performed a sound practical penance\\nfor her folly, every day of her life.', 'It has been said that Mrs Quilp was pining in her bower.', 'In her bower\\nshe was, but not alone, for besides the old lady her mother of whom\\nmention has recently been made, there were present some half-dozen\\nladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident (and\\nalso by a little understanding among themselves) to drop in one after\\nanother, just about tea-time.', 'This being a season favourable to\\nconversation, and the room being a cool, shady, lazy kind of place,\\nwith some plants at the open window shutting out the dust, and\\ninterposing pleasantly enough between the tea table within and the old\\nTower without, it is no wonder that the ladies felt an inclination to\\ntalk and linger, especially when there are taken into account the\\nadditional inducements of fresh butter, new bread, shrimps, and\\nwatercresses.', 'Now, the ladies being together under these circumstances, it was\\nextremely natural that the discourse should turn upon the propensity of\\nmankind to tyrannize over the weaker sex, and the duty that developed\\nupon the weaker sex to resist that tyranny and assert their rights and\\ndignity.', 'It was natural for four reasons: firstly, because Mrs Quilp\\nbeing a young woman and notoriously under the dominion of her husband\\nought to be excited to rebel; secondly, because Mrs Quilp’s parent was\\nknown to be laudably shrewish in her disposition and inclined to resist\\nmale authority; thirdly, because each visitor wished to show for\\nherself how superior she was in this respect to the generality of her\\nsex; and fourthly, because the company being accustomed to scandalise\\neach other in pairs, were deprived of their usual subject of\\nconversation now that they were all assembled in close friendship, and\\nhad consequently no better employment than to attack the common enemy.', 'Moved by these considerations, a stout lady opened the proceedings by\\ninquiring, with an air of great concern and sympathy, how Mr Quilp was;\\nwhereunto Mr Quilp’s wife’s mother replied sharply, ‘Oh!', 'He was well\\nenough--nothing much was every the matter with him--and ill weeds were\\nsure to thrive.’ All the ladies then sighed in concert, shook their\\nheads gravely, and looked at Mrs Quilp as a martyr.', '‘Ah!’ said the spokeswoman, ‘I wish you’d give her a little of your\\nadvice, Mrs Jiniwin’--Mrs Quilp had been a Miss Jiniwin it should be\\nobserved--‘nobody knows better than you, ma’am, what us women owe to\\nourselves.’\\n\\n‘Owe indeed, ma’am!’ replied Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘When my poor husband, her\\ndear father, was alive, if he had ever ventured a cross word to me, I’d\\nhave--’ The good old lady did not finish the sentence, but she twisted\\noff the head of a shrimp with a vindictiveness which seemed to imply\\nthat the action was in some degree a substitute for words.', 'In this\\nlight it was clearly understood by the other party, who immediately\\nreplied with great approbation, ‘You quite enter into my feelings,\\nma’am, and it’s jist what I’d do myself.’\\n\\n‘But you have no call to do it,’ said Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘Luckily for you,\\nyou have no more occasion to do it than I had.’\\n\\n‘No woman need have, if she was true to herself,’ rejoined the stout\\nlady.', '‘Do you hear that, Betsy?’ said Mrs Jiniwin, in a warning voice.', '‘How\\noften have I said the same words to you, and almost gone down my knees\\nwhen I spoke ‘em!’\\n\\nPoor Mrs Quilp, who had looked in a state of helplessness from one face\\nof condolence to another, coloured, smiled, and shook her head\\ndoubtfully.', 'This was the signal for a general clamour, which beginning\\nin a low murmur gradually swelled into a great noise in which everybody\\nspoke at once, and all said that she being a young woman had no right\\nto set up her opinions against the experiences of those who knew so\\nmuch better; that it was very wrong of her not to take the advice of\\npeople who had nothing at heart but her good; that it was next door to\\nbeing downright ungrateful to conduct herself in that manner; that if\\nshe had no respect for herself she ought to have some for other women,\\nall of whom she compromised by her meekness; and that if she had no\\nrespect for other women, the time would come when other women would\\nhave no respect for her; and she would be very sorry for that, they\\ncould tell her.', 'Having dealt out these admonitions, the ladies fell to\\na more powerful assault than they had yet made upon the  mixed tea, new\\nbread, fresh butter, shrimps, and watercresses, and said that their\\nvexation was so great to see her going on like that, that they could\\nhardly bring themselves to eat a single morsel.', 'It’s all very fine to talk,’ said Mrs Quilp with much simplicity, ‘but\\nI know that if I was to die to-morrow, Quilp could marry anybody he\\npleased--now that he could, I know!’\\n\\nThere was quite a scream of indignation at this idea.', 'Marry whom he\\npleased!', 'They would like to see him dare to think of marrying any of\\nthem; they would like to see the faintest approach to such a thing.', 'One lady (a widow) was quite certain she should stab him if he hinted\\nat it.', '‘Very well,’ said Mrs Quilp, nodding her head, ‘as I said just now,\\nit’s very easy to talk, but I say again that I know--that I’m\\nsure--Quilp has such a way with him when he likes, that the best\\nlooking woman here couldn’t refuse him if I was dead, and she was free,\\nand he chose to make love to her.', 'Come!’\\n\\nEverybody bridled up at this remark, as much as to say, ‘I know you\\nmean me.', 'Let him try--that’s all.’ and yet for some hidden reason they\\nwere all angry with the widow, and each lady whispered in her\\nneighbour’s ear that it was very plain that said widow thought herself\\nthe person referred to, and what a puss she was!', '‘Mother knows,’ said Mrs Quilp, ‘that what I say is quite correct, for\\nshe often said so before we were married.', 'Didn’t you say so, mother?’\\n\\nThis inquiry involved the respected lady in rather a delicate position,\\nfor she certainly had been an active party in making her daughter Mrs\\nQuilp, and, besides, it was not supporting the family credit to\\nencourage the idea that she had married a man whom nobody else would\\nhave.', 'On the other hand, to exaggerate the captivating qualities of her\\nson-in-law would be to weaken the cause of revolt, in which all her\\nenergies were deeply engaged.', 'Beset by these opposing considerations,\\nMrs Jiniwin admitted the powers of insinuation, but denied the right to\\ngovern, and with a timely compliment to the stout lady brought back the\\ndiscussion to the point from which it had strayed.', '‘Oh!', 'It’s a sensible and proper thing indeed, what Mrs George has\\nsaid!’ exclaimed the old lady.', '‘If women are only true to\\nthemselves!--But Betsy isn’t, and more’s the shame and pity.’\\n\\n‘Before I’d let a man order me about as Quilp orders her,’ said Mrs\\nGeorge, ‘before I’d consent to stand in awe of a man as she does of\\nhim, I’d--I’d kill myself, and write a letter first to say he did it!’\\n\\nThis remark being loudly commended and approved of, another lady (from\\nthe Minories) put in her word:\\n\\n‘Mr Quilp may be a very nice man,’ said this lady, ‘and I supposed\\nthere’s no doubt he is, because Mrs Quilp says he is, and Mrs Jiniwin\\nsays he is, and they ought to know, or nobody does.', 'But still he is not\\nquite a--what one calls a handsome man, nor quite a young man neither,\\nwhich might be a little excuse for him if anything could be; whereas\\nhis wife is young, and is good-looking, and is a woman--which is the\\ngreatest thing after all.’\\n\\nThis last clause being delivered with extraordinary pathos, elicited a\\ncorresponding murmer from the hearers, stimulated by which the lady\\nwent on to remark that if such a husband was cross and unreasonable\\nwith such a wife, then--\\n\\n‘If he is!’ interposed the mother, putting down her tea-cup and\\nbrushing the crumbs out of her lap, preparatory to making a solemn\\ndeclaration.', '‘If he is!', 'He is the greatest tyrant that every lived, she\\ndaren’t call her soul her own, he makes her tremble with a word and\\neven with a look, he frightens her to death, and she hasn’t the spirit\\nto give him a word back, no, not a single word.’\\n\\nNotwithstanding that the fact had been notorious beforehand to all the\\ntea-drinkers, and had been discussed and expatiated on at every\\ntea-drinking in the neighbourhood for the last twelve months, this\\nofficial communication was no sooner made than they all began to talk\\nat once and to vie with each other in vehemence and volubility.', 'Mrs\\nGeorge remarked that people would talk, that people had often said this\\nto her before, that Mrs Simmons then and there present had told her so\\ntwenty times, that she had always said, ‘No, Henrietta Simmons, unless\\nI see it with my own eyes and hear it with my own ears, I never will\\nbelieve it.’ Mrs Simmons corroborated this testimony and added strong\\nevidence of her own.', 'The lady from the Minories recounted a successful\\ncourse of treatment under which she had placed her own husband, who,\\nfrom manifesting one month after marriage unequivocal symptoms of the\\ntiger, had by this means become subdued into a perfect lamb.', 'Another\\nlady recounted her own personal struggle and final triumph, in the\\ncourse whereof she had found it necessary to call in her mother and two\\naunts, and to weep incessantly night and day for six weeks.', 'A third,\\nwho in the general confusion could secure no other listener, fastened\\nherself upon a young woman still unmarried who happened to be amongst\\nthem, and conjured her, as she valued her own peace of mind and\\nhappiness to profit by this solemn occasion, to take example from the\\nweakness of Mrs Quilp, and from that time forth to direct her whole\\nthoughts to taming and subduing the rebellious spirit of man.', 'The noise\\nwas at its height, and half the company had elevated their voices into\\na perfect shriek in order to drown the voices of the other half, when\\nMrs Jiniwin was seen to change colour and shake her forefinger\\nstealthily, as if exhorting them to silence.', 'Then, and not until then,\\nDaniel Quilp himself, the cause and occasion of all this clamour, was\\nobserved to be in the room, looking on and listening with profound\\nattention.', '‘Go on, ladies, go on,’ said Daniel.', '‘Mrs Quilp, pray ask the ladies to\\nstop to supper, and have a couple of lobsters and something light and\\npalatable.’\\n\\n‘I--I--didn’t ask them to tea, Quilp,’ stammered his wife.', '‘It’s quite\\nan accident.’\\n\\n‘So much the better, Mrs Quilp; these accidental parties are always the\\npleasantest,’ said the dwarf, rubbing his hands so hard that he seemed\\nto be engaged in manufacturing, of the dirt with which they were\\nencrusted, little charges for popguns.', '‘What!', 'Not going, ladies, you\\nare not going, surely!’\\n\\nHis fair enemies tossed their heads slightly as they sought their\\nrespective bonnets and shawls, but left all verbal contention to Mrs\\nJiniwin, who finding herself in the position of champion, made a faint\\nstruggle to sustain the character.', '‘And why not stop to supper, Quilp,’ said the old lady, ‘if my daughter\\nhad a mind?’\\n\\n‘To be sure,’ rejoined Daniel.', '‘Why not?’\\n\\n‘There’s nothing dishonest or wrong in a supper, I hope?’ said Mrs\\nJiniwin.', '‘Surely not,’ returned the dwarf.', '‘Why should there be?', 'Nor anything\\nunwholesome, either, unless there’s lobster-salad or prawns, which I’m\\ntold are not good for digestion.’\\n\\n‘And you wouldn’t like your wife to be attacked with that, or anything\\nelse that would make her uneasy would you?’ said Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘Not for a score of worlds,’ replied the dwarf with a grin.', '‘Not even\\nto have a score of mothers-in-law at the same time--and what a blessing\\nthat would be!’\\n\\n‘My daughter’s your wife, Mr Quilp, certainly,’ said the old lady with\\na giggle, meant for satirical and to imply that he needed to be\\nreminded of the fact; ‘your wedded wife.’\\n\\n‘So she is, certainly.', 'So she is,’ observed the dwarf.', '‘And she has a right to do as she likes, I hope, Quilp,’ said the\\nold lady trembling, partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of\\nher impish son-in-law.', '‘Hope she has!’ he replied.', '‘Oh!', 'Don’t you know she has?', 'Don’t you know\\nshe has, Mrs Jiniwin?', '‘I know she ought to have, Quilp, and would have, if she was of my way\\nof thinking.’\\n\\n‘Why an’t you of your mother’s way of thinking, my dear?’ said the\\ndwarf, turing round and addressing his wife, ‘why don’t you always\\nimitate your mother, my dear?', 'She’s the ornament of her sex--your\\nfather said so every day of his life.', 'I am sure he did.’\\n\\n‘Her father was a blessed creetur, Quilp, and worthy twenty thousand of\\nsome people,’ said Mrs Jiniwin; ‘twenty hundred million thousand.’\\n\\n‘I should like to have known him,’ remarked the dwarf.', '‘I dare say he\\nwas a blessed creature then; but I’m sure he is now.', 'It was a happy\\nrelease.', 'I believe he had suffered a long time?’\\n\\nThe old lady gave a gasp, but nothing came of it; Quilp resumed, with\\nthe same malice in his eye and the same sarcastic politeness on his\\ntongue.', '‘You look ill, Mrs Jiniwin; I know you have been exciting yourself too\\nmuch--talking perhaps, for it is your weakness.', 'Go to bed.', 'Do go to\\nbed.’\\n\\n‘I shall go when I please, Quilp, and not before.’\\n\\n‘But please to do now.', 'Do please to go now,’ said the dwarf.', 'The old woman looked angrily at him, but retreated as he advanced, and\\nfalling back before him, suffered him to shut the door upon her and\\nbolt her out among the guests, who were by this time crowding\\ndownstairs.', 'Being left along with his wife, who sat trembling in a\\ncorner with her eyes fixed upon the ground, the little man planted\\nhimself before her, and folding his arms looked steadily at her for a\\nlong time without speaking.', '‘Mrs Quilp,’ he said at last.', '‘Yes, Quilp,’ she replead meekly.', 'Instead of pursuing the theme he had in his mind, Quilp folded his arms\\nagain, and looked at her more sternly than before, while she averted\\nher eyes and kept them on the ground.', '‘Mrs Quilp.’\\n\\n‘Yes, Quilp.’\\n\\n‘If ever you listen to these beldames again, I’ll bite you.’\\n\\nWith this laconic threat, which he accompanied with a snarl that gave\\nhim the appearance of being particularly in earnest, Mr Quilp bade her\\nclear the teaboard away, and bring the rum.', 'The spirit being set before\\nhim in a huge case-bottle, which had originally come out of some ship’s\\nlocker, he settled himself in an arm-chair with his large head and face\\nsqueezed up against the back, and his little legs planted on the table.', '‘Now, Mrs Quilp,’ he said; ‘I feel in a smoking humour, and shall\\nprobably blaze away all night.', 'But sit where you are, if you please, in\\ncase I want you.’\\n\\nHis wife returned no other reply than the necessary ‘Yes, Quilp,’ and\\nthe small lord of the creation took his first cigar and mixed his first\\nglass of grog.', 'The sun went down and the stars peeped out, the Tower\\nturned from its own proper colours to grey and from grey to black, the\\nroom became perfectly dark and the end of the cigar a deep fiery red,\\nbut still Mr Quilp went on smoking and drinking in the same position,\\nand staring listlessly out of window with the doglike smile always on\\nhis face, save when Mrs Quilp made some involuntary movement of\\nrestlessness or fatigue; and then it expanded into a grin of delight.', 'CHAPTER 5\\n\\nWhether Mr Quilp took any sleep by snatches of a few winks at a time,\\nor whether he sat with his eyes wide open all night long, certain it is\\nthat he kept his cigar alight, and kindled every fresh one from the\\nashes of that which was nearly consumed, without requiring the\\nassistance of a candle.', 'Nor did the striking of the clocks, hour after\\nhour, appear to inspire him with any sense of drowsiness or any natural\\ndesire to go to rest, but rather to increase his wakefulness, which he\\nshowed, at every such indication of the progress of the night, by a\\nsuppressed cackling in his throat, and a motion of his shoulders, like\\none who laughs heartily but the same time slyly and by stealth.', 'At length the day broke, and poor Mrs Quilp, shivering with cold of\\nearly morning and harassed by fatigue and want of sleep, was discovered\\nsitting patiently on her chair, raising her eyes at intervals in mute\\nappeal to the compassion and clemency of her lord, and gently reminding\\nhim by an occasion cough that she was still unpardoned and that her\\npenance had been of long duration.', 'But her dwarfish spouse still smoked\\nhis cigar and drank his rum without heeding her; and it was not until\\nthe sun had some time risen, and the activity and noise of city day\\nwere rife in the street, that he deigned to recognize her presence by\\nany word or sign.', 'He might not have done so even then, but for certain\\nimpatient tapping at the door he seemed to denote that some pretty hard\\nknuckles were actively engaged upon the other side.', '‘Why dear me!’ he said looking round with a malicious grin, ‘it’s day.', 'Open the door, sweet Mrs Quilp!’\\n\\nHis obedient wife withdrew the bolt, and her lady mother entered.', 'Now, Mrs Jiniwin bounced into the room with great impetuosity; for,\\nsupposing her son-in-law to be still a-bed, she had come to relieve her\\nfeelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and\\ncharacter.', 'Seeing that he was up and dressed, and that the room\\nappeared to have been occupied ever since she quitted it on the\\nprevious evening, she stopped short, in some embarrassment.', 'Nothing escaped the hawk’s eye of the ugly little man, who, perfectly\\nunderstanding what passed in the old lady’s mind, turned uglier still\\nin the fulness of his satisfaction, and bade her good morning, with a\\nleer or triumph.', '‘Why, Betsy,’ said the old woman, ‘you haven’t been--you don’t mean to\\nsay you’ve been a--’\\n\\n‘Sitting up all night?’ said Quilp, supplying the conclusion of the\\nsentence.', '‘Yes she has!’\\n\\n‘All night?’ cried Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘Ay, all night.', 'Is the dear old lady deaf?’ said Quilp, with a smile of\\nwhich a frown was part.', '‘Who says man and wife are bad company?', 'Ha ha!', 'The time has flown.’\\n\\n‘You’re a brute!’ exclaimed Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘Come come,’ said Quilp, wilfully misunderstanding her, of course, ‘you\\nmustn’t call her names.', 'She’s married now, you know.', 'And though she did\\nbeguile the time and keep me from my bed, you must not be so tenderly\\ncareful of me as to be out of humour with her.', 'Bless you for a dear\\nold lady.', 'Here’s to your health!’\\n\\n‘I am much obliged to you,’ returned the old woman, testifying by a\\ncertain restlessness in her hands a vehement desire to shake her\\nmatronly fist at her son-in-law.', '‘Oh!', 'I’m very much obliged to you!’\\n\\n‘Grateful soul!’ cried the dwarf.', '‘Mrs Quilp.’\\n\\n‘Yes, Quilp,’ said the timid sufferer.', '‘Help your mother to get breakfast, Mrs Quilp.', 'I am going to the wharf\\nthis morning--the earlier the better, so be quick.’\\n\\nMrs Jiniwin made a faint demonstration of rebellion by sitting down in\\na chair near the door and folding her arms as if in a resolute\\ndetermination to do nothing.', 'But a few whispered words from her\\ndaughter, and a kind inquiry from her son-in-law whether she felt\\nfaint, with a hint that there was abundance of cold water in the next\\napartment, routed these symptoms effectually, and she applied herself\\nto the prescribed preparations with sullen diligence.', 'While they were in progress, Mr Quilp withdrew to the adjoining room,\\nand, turning back his coat-collar, proceeded to smear his countenance\\nwith a damp towel of very unwholesome appearance, which made his\\ncomplexion rather more cloudy than it was before.', 'But, while he was\\nthus engaged, his caution and inquisitiveness did not forsake him, for\\nwith a face as sharp and cunning as ever, he often stopped, even in\\nthis short process, and stood listening for any conversation in the\\nnext room, of which he might be the theme.', '‘Ah!’ he said after a short effort of attention, ‘it was not the towel\\nover my ears, I thought it wasn’t.', 'I’m a little hunchy villain and a\\nmonster, am I, Mrs Jiniwin?', 'Oh!’\\n\\nThe pleasure of this discovery called up the old doglike smile in full\\nforce.', 'When he had quite done with it, he shook himself in a very\\ndoglike manner, and rejoined the ladies.', 'Mr Quilp now walked up to front of a looking-glass, and was standing\\nthere putting on his neckerchief, when Mrs Jiniwin happening to be\\nbehind him, could not resist the inclination she felt to shake her fist\\nat her tyrant son-in-law.', 'It was the gesture of an instant, but as she\\ndid so and accompanied the action with a menacing look, she met his eye\\nin the glass, catching her in the very act.', 'The same glance at the\\nmirror conveyed to her the reflection of a horribly grotesque and\\ndistorted face with the tongue lolling out; and the next instant the\\ndwarf, turning about with a perfectly bland and placid look, inquired\\nin a tone of great affection.', '‘How are you now, my dear old darling?’\\n\\nSlight and ridiculous as the incident was, it made him appear such a\\nlittle fiend, and withal such a keen and knowing one, that the old\\nwoman felt too much afraid of him to utter a single word, and suffered\\nherself to be led with extraordinary politeness to the breakfast-table.', 'Here he by no means diminished the impression he had just produced, for\\nhe ate hard eggs, shell and all, devoured gigantic prawns with the\\nheads and tails on, chewed tobacco and water-cresses at the same time\\nand with extraordinary greediness, drank boiling tea without winking,\\nbit his fork and spoon till they bent again, and in short performed so\\nmany horrifying and uncommon acts that the women were nearly frightened\\nout of their wits, and began to doubt if he were really a human\\ncreature.', 'At last, having gone through these proceedings and many\\nothers which were equally a part of his system, Mr Quilp left them,\\nreduced to a very obedient and humbled state, and betook himself to the\\nriver-side, where he took boat for the wharf on which he had bestowed\\nhis name.', 'It was flood tide when Daniel Quilp sat himself down in the ferry to\\ncross to the opposite shore.', 'A fleet of barges were coming lazily on,\\nsome sideways, some head first, some stern first; all in a\\nwrong-headed, dogged, obstinate way, bumping up against the larger\\ncraft, running under the bows of steamboats, getting into every kind of\\nnook and corner where they had no business, and being crunched on all\\nsides like so many walnut-shells; while each with its pair of long\\nsweeps struggling and splashing in the water looked like some lumbering\\nfish in pain.', 'In some of the vessels at anchor all hands were busily\\nengaged in coiling ropes, spreading out sails to dry, taking in or\\ndischarging their cargoes; in others no life was visible but two or\\nthree tarry boys, and perhaps a barking dog running to and fro upon the\\ndeck or scrambling up to look over the side and bark the louder for the\\nview.', 'Coming slowly on through the forests of masts was a great\\nsteamship, beating the water in short impatient strokes with her heavy\\npaddles as though she wanted room to breathe, and advancing in her huge\\nbulk like a sea monster among the minnows of the Thames.', 'On either hand\\nwere long black tiers of colliers; between them vessels slowly working\\nout of harbour with sails glistening in the sun, and creaking noise on\\nboard, re-echoed from a hundred quarters.', 'The water and all upon it was\\nin active motion, dancing and buoyant and bubbling up; while the old\\ngrey Tower and piles of building on the shore, with many a church-spire\\nshooting up between, looked coldly on, and seemed to disdain their\\nchafing, restless neighbour.', 'Daniel Quilp, who was not much affected by a bright morning save in so\\nfar as it spared him the trouble of carrying an umbrella, caused\\nhimself to be put ashore hard by the wharf, and proceeded thither\\nthrough a narrow lane which, partaking of the amphibious character of\\nits frequenters, had as much water as mud in its composition, and a\\nvery liberal supply of both.', 'Arrived at his destination, the first\\nobject that presented itself to his view was a pair of very imperfectly\\nshod feet elevated in the air with the soles upwards, which remarkable\\nappearance was referable to the boy, who being of an eccentric spirit\\nand having a natural taste for tumbling, was now standing on his head\\nand contemplating the aspect of the river under these uncommon\\ncircumstances.', 'He was speedily brought on his heels by the sound of his\\nmaster’s voice, and as soon as his head was in its right position, Mr\\nQuilp, to speak expressively in the absence of a better verb, ‘punched\\nit’ for him.', '‘Come, you let me alone,’ said the boy, parrying Quilp’s hand with both\\nhis elbows alternatively.', '‘You’ll get something you won’t like if you\\ndon’t and so I tell you.’\\n\\n‘You dog,’ snarled Quilp, ‘I’ll beat you with an iron rod, I’ll scratch\\nyou with a rusty nail, I’ll pinch your eyes, if you talk to me--I will.’\\n\\nWith these threats he clenched his hand again, and dexterously diving\\nin between the elbows and catching the boy’s head as it dodged from\\nside to side, gave it three or four good hard knocks.', 'Having now\\ncarried his point and insisted on it, he left off.', '‘You won’t do it agin,’ said the boy, nodding his head and drawing\\nback, with the elbows ready in case of the worst; ‘now--’\\n\\n‘Stand still, you dog,’ said Quilp.', '‘I won’t do it again, because I’ve\\ndone it as often as I want.', 'Here.', 'Take the key.’\\n\\n‘Why don’t you hit one of your size?’ said the boy approaching very\\nslowly.', '‘Where is there one of my size, you dog?’ returned Quilp.', '‘Take the\\nkey, or I’ll brain you with it’--indeed he gave him a smart tap with\\nthe handle as he spoke.', '‘Now, open the counting-house.’\\n\\nThe boy sulkily complied, muttering at first, but desisting when he\\nlooked round and saw that Quilp was following him with a steady look.', 'And here it may be remarked, that between this boy and the dwarf there\\nexisted a strange kind of mutual liking.', 'How born or bred, and or\\nnourished upon blows and threats on one side, and retorts and defiances\\non the other, is not to the purpose.', 'Quilp would certainly suffer\\nnobody to contract him but the boy, and the boy would assuredly not\\nhave submitted to be so knocked about by anybody but Quilp, when he had\\nthe power to run away at any time he chose.', '‘Now,’ said Quilp, passing into the wooden counting-house, ‘you mind\\nthe wharf.', 'Stand upon your head agin, and I’ll cut one of your feet\\noff.’\\n\\nThe boy made no answer, but directly Quilp had shut himself in, stood\\non his head before the door, then walked on his hands to the back and\\nstood on his head there, and then to the opposite side and repeated the\\nperformance.', 'There were indeed four sides to the counting-house, but he\\navoided that one where the window was, deeming it probable that Quilp\\nwould be looking out of it.', 'This was prudent, for in point of fact, the\\ndwarf, knowing his disposition, was lying in wait at a little distance\\nfrom the sash armed with a large piece of wood, which, being rough and\\njagged and studded in many parts with broken nails, might possibly have\\nhurt him.', 'It was a dirty little box, this counting-house, with nothing in it but\\nan old ricketty desk and two stools, a hat-peg, an ancient almanack, an\\ninkstand with no ink, and the stump of one pen, and an eight-day clock\\nwhich hadn’t gone for eighteen years at least, and of which the\\nminute-hand had been twisted off for a tooth-pick.', 'Daniel Quilp pulled\\nhis hat over his brows, climbed on to the desk (which had a flat top)\\nand stretching his short length upon it went to sleep with ease of an\\nold practitioner; intending, no doubt, to compensate himself for the\\ndeprivation of last night’s rest, by a long and sound nap.', 'Sound it might have been, but long it was not, for he had not been\\nasleep a quarter of an hour when the boy opened the door and thrust in\\nhis head, which was like a bundle of badly-picked oakum.', 'Quilp was a\\nlight sleeper and started up directly.', '‘Here’s somebody for you,’ said the boy.', '‘Who?’\\n\\n‘I don’t know.’\\n\\n‘Ask!’ said Quilp, seizing the trifle of wood before mentioned and\\nthrowing it at him with such dexterity that it was well the boy\\ndisappeared before it reached the spot on which he had stood.', '‘Ask, you\\ndog.’\\n\\nNot caring to venture within range of such missles again, the boy\\ndiscreetly sent in his stead the first cause of the interruption, who\\nnow presented herself at the door.', '‘What, Nelly!’ cried Quilp.', '‘Yes,’ said the child, hesitating whether to enter or retreat, for the\\ndwarf just roused, with his dishevelled hair hanging all about him and\\na yellow handkerchief over his head, was something fearful to behold;\\nit’s only me, sir.’\\n\\n‘Come in,’ said Quilp, without getting off the desk.', '‘Come in.', 'Stay.', 'Just look out into the yard, and see whether there’s a boy standing on\\nhis head.’\\n\\n‘No, sir,’ replied Nell.', '‘He’s on his feet.’\\n\\n‘You’re sure he is?’ said Quilp.', '‘Well.', 'Now, come in and shut the door.', 'What’s your message, Nelly?’\\n\\nThe child handed him a letter.', 'Mr Quilp, without changing his position\\nfurther than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin\\non his hand, proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents.', 'CHAPTER 6\\n\\nLittle Nell stood timidly by, with her eyes raised to the countenance\\nof Mr Quilp as he read the letter, plainly showing by her looks that\\nwhile she entertained some fear and distrust of the little man, she was\\nmuch inclined to laugh at his uncouth appearance and grotesque\\nattitude.', 'And yet there was visible on the part of the child a painful\\nanxiety for his reply, and consciousness of his power to render it\\ndisagreeable or distressing, which was strongly at variance with this\\nimpulse and restrained it more effectually than she could possibly have\\ndone by any efforts of her own.', 'That Mr Quilp was himself perplexed, and that in no small degree, by\\nthe contents of the letter, was sufficiently obvious.', 'Before he had got\\nthrough the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very\\nwide and to frown most horribly, the next two or three caused him to\\nscratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner, and when he came to\\nthe conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and\\ndismay.', 'After folding and laying it down beside him, he bit the nails\\nof all of his ten fingers with extreme voracity; and taking it up\\nsharply, read it again.', 'The second perusal was to all appearance as\\nunsatisfactory as the first, and plunged him into a profound reverie\\nfrom which he awakened to another assault upon his nails and a long\\nstare at the child, who with her eyes turned towards the ground awaited\\nhis further pleasure.', '‘Halloa here!’ he said at length, in a voice, and with a suddenness,\\nwhich made the child start as though a gun had been fired off at her\\near.', '‘Nelly!’\\n\\n‘Yes, sir.’\\n\\n‘Do you know what’s inside this letter, Nell?’\\n\\n‘No, sir!’\\n\\n‘Are you sure, quite sure, quite certain, upon your soul?’\\n\\n‘Quite sure, sir.’\\n\\n‘Do you wish you may die if you do know, hey?’ said the dwarf.', '‘Indeed I don’t know,’ returned the child.', '‘Well!’ muttered Quilp as he marked her earnest look.', '‘I believe you.', 'Humph!', 'Gone already?', 'Gone in four-and-twenty hours!', 'What the devil has\\nhe done with it, that’s the mystery!’\\n\\nThis reflection set him scratching his head and biting his nails once\\nmore.', 'While he was thus employed his features gradually relaxed into\\nwhat was with him a cheerful smile, but which in any other man would\\nhave been a ghastly grin of pain, and when the child looked up again\\nshe found that he was regarding her with extraordinary favour and\\ncomplacency.', '‘You look very pretty to-day, Nelly, charmingly pretty.', 'Are you tired,\\nNelly?’\\n\\n‘No, sir.', 'I’m in a hurry to get back, for he will be anxious while I am\\naway.’\\n\\n‘There’s no hurry, little Nell, no hurry at all,’ said Quilp.', '‘How\\nshould you like to be my number two, Nelly?’\\n\\n‘To be what, sir?’\\n\\n‘My number two, Nelly, my second, my Mrs Quilp,’ said the dwarf.', 'The child looked frightened, but seemed not to understand him, which Mr\\nQuilp observing, hastened to make his meaning more distinctly.', '‘To be Mrs Quilp the second, when Mrs Quilp the first is dead, sweet\\nNell,’ said Quilp, wrinkling up his eyes and luring her towards him\\nwith his bent forefinger, ‘to be my wife, my little cherry-cheeked,\\nred-lipped wife.', 'Say that Mrs Quilp lives five year, or only four,\\nyou’ll be just the proper age for me.', 'Ha ha!', 'Be a good girl, Nelly, a\\nvery good girl, and see if one of these days you don’t come to be Mrs\\nQuilp of Tower Hill.’\\n\\nSo far from being sustained and stimulated by this delightful prospect,\\nthe child shrank from him in great agitation, and trembled violently.', 'Mr Quilp, either because frightening anybody afforded him a\\nconstitutional delight, or because it was pleasant to contemplate the\\ndeath of Mrs Quilp number one, and the elevation of Mrs Quilp number\\ntwo to her post and title, or because he was determined from purposes\\nof his own to be agreeable and good-humoured at that particular time,\\nonly laughed and feigned to take no heed of her alarm.', '‘You shall come with me to Tower Hill and see Mrs Quilp that is,\\ndirectly,’ said the dwarf.', '‘She’s very fond of you, Nell, though not so\\nfond as I am.', 'You shall come home with me.’\\n\\n‘I must go back indeed,’ said the child.', '‘He told me to return directly\\nI had the answer.’\\n\\n‘But you haven’t it, Nelly,’ retorted the dwarf, ‘and won’t have it,\\nand can’t have it, until I have been home, so you see that to do your\\nerrand, you must go with me.', 'Reach me yonder hat, my dear, and we’ll go\\ndirectly.’ With that, Mr Quilp suffered himself to roll gradually off\\nthe desk until his short legs touched the ground, when he got upon them\\nand led the way from the counting-house to the wharf outside, when the\\nfirst objects that presented themselves were the boy who had stood on\\nhis head and another young gentleman of about his own stature, rolling\\nin the mud together, locked in a tight embrace, and cuffing each other\\nwith mutual heartiness.', '‘It’s Kit!’ cried Nelly, clasping her hand, ‘poor Kit who came with me!', 'Oh, pray stop them, Mr Quilp!’\\n\\n‘I’ll stop ‘em,’ cried Quilp, diving into the little counting-house and\\nreturning with a thick stick, ‘I’ll stop ‘em.', 'Now, my boys, fight away.', 'I’ll fight you both.', 'I’ll take both of you, both together, both\\ntogether!’\\n\\nWith which defiances the dwarf flourished his cudgel, and dancing round\\nthe combatants and treading upon them and skipping over them, in a kind\\nof frenzy, laid about him, now on one and now on the other, in a most\\ndesperate manner, always aiming at their heads and dealing such blows\\nas none but the veriest little savage would have inflicted.', 'This being\\nwarmer work than they had calculated upon, speedily cooled the courage\\nof the belligerents, who scrambled to their feet and called for quarter.', '‘I’ll beat you to a pulp, you dogs,’ said Quilp, vainly endeavoring to\\nget near either of them for a parting blow.', '‘I’ll bruise you until\\nyou’re copper-coloured, I’ll break your faces till you haven’t a\\nprofile between you, I will.’\\n\\n‘Come, you drop that stick or it’ll be worse for you,’ said his boy,\\ndodging round him and watching an opportunity to rush in; ‘you drop\\nthat stick.’\\n\\n‘Come a little nearer, and I’ll drop it on your skull, you dog,’ said\\nQuilp, with gleaming eyes; ‘a little nearer--nearer yet.’\\n\\nBut the boy declined the invitation until his master was apparently a\\nlittle off his guard, when he darted in and seizing the weapon tried to\\nwrest it from his grasp.', 'Quilp, who was as strong as a lion, easily\\nkept his hold until the boy was tugging at it with his utmost power,\\nwhen he suddenly let it go and sent him reeling backwards, so that he\\nfell violently upon his head.', 'The success of this manoeuvre tickled Mr\\nQuilp beyond description, and he laughed and stamped upon the ground as\\nat a most irresistible jest.', '‘Never mind,’ said the boy, nodding his head and rubbing it at the same\\ntime; ‘you see if ever I offer to strike anybody again because they say\\nyou’re an uglier dwarf than can be seen anywheres for a penny, that’s\\nall.’\\n\\n‘Do you mean to say, I’m not, you dog?’ returned Quilp.', '‘No!’ retorted the boy.', '‘Then what do you fight on my wharf for, you villain?’ said Quilp.', '‘Because he said so,’ replied the boy, pointing to Kit, ‘not because you\\nan’t.’\\n\\n‘Then why did he say,’ bawled Kit, ‘that Miss Nelly was ugly, and that\\nshe and my master was obliged to do whatever his master liked?', 'Why did\\nhe say that?’\\n\\n‘He said what he did because he’s a fool, and you said what you did\\nbecause you’re very wise and clever--almost too clever to live, unless\\nyou’re very careful of yourself, Kit.’ said Quilp, with great suavity\\nin his manner, but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth.', '‘Here’s sixpence for you, Kit.', 'Always speak the truth.', 'At all times,\\nKit, speak the truth.', 'Lock the counting-house, you dog, and bring me\\nthe key.’\\n\\nThe other boy, to whom this order was addressed, did as he was told,\\nand was rewarded for his partizanship in behalf of his master, by a\\ndexterous rap on the nose with the key, which brought the water into\\nhis eyes.', 'Then Mr Quilp departed with the child and Kit in a boat, and\\nthe boy revenged himself by dancing on his head at intervals on the\\nextreme verge of the wharf, during the whole time they crossed the\\nriver.', 'There was only Mrs Quilp at home, and she, little expecting the return\\nof her lord, was just composing herself for a refreshing slumber when\\nthe sound of his footsteps roused her.', 'She had barely time to seem to\\nbe occupied in some needle-work, when he entered, accompanied by the\\nchild; having left Kit downstairs.', '‘Here’s Nelly Trent, dear Mrs Quilp,’ said her husband.', '‘A glass of\\nwine, my dear, and a biscuit, for she has had a long walk.', 'She’ll sit\\nwith you, my soul, while I write a letter.’\\n\\nMrs Quilp looked tremblingly in her spouse’s face to know what this\\nunusual courtesy might portend, and obedient to the summons she saw in\\nhis gesture, followed him into the next room.', '‘Mind what I say to you,’ whispered Quilp.', '‘See if you can get out of\\nher anything about her grandfather, or what they do, or how they live,\\nor what he tells her.', 'I’ve my reasons for knowing, if I can.', 'You women\\ntalk more freely to one another than you do to us, and you have a soft,\\nmild way with you that’ll win upon her.', 'Do you hear?’\\n\\n‘Yes, Quilp.’\\n\\n‘Go then.', 'What’s the matter now?’\\n\\n‘Dear Quilp,’ faltered his wife.', '‘I love the child--if you could do\\nwithout making me deceive her--’\\n\\nThe dwarf muttering a terrible oath looked round as if for some weapon\\nwith which to inflict condign punishment upon his disobedient wife.', 'The\\nsubmissive little woman hurriedly entreated him not to be angry, and\\npromised to do as he bade her.', '‘Do you hear me,’ whispered Quilp, nipping and pinching her arm; ‘worm\\nyourself into her secrets; I know you can.', 'I’m listening, recollect.', 'If\\nyou’re not sharp enough, I’ll creak the door, and woe betide you if I\\nhave to creak it much.', 'Go!’\\n\\nMrs Quilp departed according to order, and her amiable husband,\\nensconcing himself behind the partly opened door, and applying his ear\\nclose to it, began to listen with a face of great craftiness and\\nattention.', 'Poor Mrs Quilp was thinking, however, in what manner to begin or what\\nkind of inquiries she could make; and it was not until the door,\\ncreaking in a very urgent manner, warned her to proceed without further\\nconsideration, that the sound of her voice was heard.', '‘How very often you have come backwards and forwards lately to Mr\\nQuilp, my dear.’\\n\\n‘I have said so to grandfather, a hundred times,’ returned Nell\\ninnocently.', '‘And what has he said to that?’\\n\\n‘Only sighed, and dropped his head, and seemed so sad and wretched that\\nif you could have seen him I am sure you must have cried; you could not\\nhave helped it more than I, I know.', 'How that door creaks!’\\n\\n‘It often does.’ returned Mrs Quilp, with an uneasy glance towards it.', '‘But your grandfather--he used not to be so wretched?’\\n\\n‘Oh, no!’ said the child eagerly, ‘so different!', 'We were once so happy\\nand he so cheerful and contented!', 'You cannot think what a sad change\\nhas fallen on us since.’\\n\\n‘I am very, very sorry, to hear you speak like this, my dear!’ said Mrs\\nQuilp.', 'And she spoke the truth.', '‘Thank you,’ returned the child, kissing her cheek, ‘you are always\\nkind to me, and it is a pleasure to talk to you.', 'I can speak to no one\\nelse about him, but poor Kit.', 'I am very happy still, I ought to feel\\nhappier perhaps than I do, but you cannot think how it grieves me\\nsometimes to see him alter so.’\\n\\n‘He’ll alter again, Nelly,’ said Mrs Quilp, ‘and be what he was before.’\\n\\n‘Oh, if God would only let that come about!’ said the child with\\nstreaming eyes; ‘but it is a long time now, since he first began to--I\\nthought I saw that door moving!’\\n\\n‘It’s the wind,’ said Mrs Quilp, faintly.', '‘Began to--’\\n\\n‘To be so thoughtful and dejected, and to forget our old way of\\nspending the time in the long evenings,’ said the child.', '‘I used to\\nread to him by the fireside, and he sat listening, and when I stopped\\nand we began to talk, he told me about my mother, and how she once\\nlooked and spoke just like me when she was a little child.', 'Then he used\\nto take me on his knee, and try to make me understand that she was not\\nlying in her grave, but had flown to a beautiful country beyond the sky\\nwhere nothing died or ever grew old--we were very happy once!’\\n\\n‘Nelly, Nelly!’ said the poor woman, ‘I can’t bear to see one as young\\nas you so sorrowful.', 'Pray don’t cry.’\\n\\n‘I do so very seldom,’ said Nell, ‘but I have kept this to myself a\\nlong time, and I am not quite well, I think, for the tears come into my\\neyes and I cannot keep them back.', 'I don’t mind telling you my grief,\\nfor I know you will not tell it to any one again.’\\n\\nMrs Quilp turned away her head and made no answer.', '‘Then,’ said the child, ‘we often walked in the fields and among the\\ngreen trees, and when we came home at night, we liked it better for\\nbeing tired, and said what a happy place it was.', 'And if it was dark and\\nrather dull, we used to say, what did it matter to us, for it only made\\nus remember our last walk with greater pleasure, and look forward to\\nour next one.', 'But now we never have these walks, and though it is the\\nsame house it is darker and much more gloomy than it used to be,\\nindeed!’\\n\\nShe paused here, but though the door creaked more than once, Mrs Quilp\\nsaid nothing.', '‘Mind you don’t suppose,’ said the child earnestly, ‘that grandfather\\nis less kind to me than he was.', 'I think he loves me better every day,\\nand is kinder and more affectionate than he was the day before.', 'You do\\nnot know how fond he is of me!’\\n\\n‘I am sure he loves you dearly,’ said Mrs Quilp.', '‘Indeed, indeed he does!’ cried Nell, ‘as dearly as I love him.', 'But I\\nhave not told you the greatest change of all, and this you must never\\nbreathe again to any one.', 'He has no sleep or rest, but that which he\\ntakes by day in his easy chair; for every night and nearly all night\\nlong he is away from home.’\\n\\n‘Nelly!’\\n\\n‘Hush!’ said the child, laying her finger on her lip and looking round.', '‘When he comes home in the morning, which is generally just before day,\\nI let him in.', 'Last night he was very late, and it was quite light.', 'I\\nsaw that his face was deadly pale, that his eyes were bloodshot, and\\nthat his legs trembled as he walked.', 'When I had gone to bed again, I\\nheard him groan.', 'I got up and ran back to him, and heard him say,\\nbefore he knew that I was there, that he could not bear his life much\\nlonger, and if it was not for the child, would wish to die.', 'What shall\\nI do!', 'Oh!', 'What shall I do!’\\n\\nThe fountains of her heart were opened; the child, overpowered by the\\nweight of her sorrows and anxieties, by the first confidence she had\\never shown, and the sympathy with which her little tale had been\\nreceived, hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend, and burst\\ninto a passion of tears.', 'In a few minutes Mr Quilp returned, and expressed the utmost surprise\\nto find her in this condition, which he did very naturally and with\\nadmirable effect, for that kind of acting had been rendered familiar to\\nhim by long practice, and he was quite at home in it.', '‘She’s tired you see, Mrs Quilp,’ said the dwarf, squinting in a\\nhideous manner to imply that his wife was to follow his lead.', '‘It’s a\\nlong way from her home to the wharf, and then she was alarmed to see a\\ncouple of young scoundrels fighting, and was timorous on the water\\nbesides.', 'All this together has been too much for her.', 'Poor Nell!’\\n\\nMr Quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have\\ndevised for the recovery of his young visitor, by patting her on the\\nhead.', 'Such an application from any other hand might not have produced a\\nremarkable effect, but the child shrank so quickly from his touch and\\nfelt such an instinctive desire to get out of his reach, that she rose\\ndirectly and declared herself ready to return.', '‘But you’d better wait, and dine with Mrs Quilp and me.’ said the dwarf.', '‘I have been away too long, sir, already,’ returned Nell, drying her\\neyes.', '‘Well,’ said Mr Quilp, ‘if you will go, you will, Nelly.', 'Here’s the\\nnote.', 'It’s only to say that I shall see him to-morrow or maybe next\\nday, and that I couldn’t do that little business for him this morning.', 'Good-bye, Nelly.', 'Here, you sir; take care of her, d’ye hear?’\\n\\nKit, who appeared at the summons, deigned to make no reply to so\\nneedless an injunction, and after staring at Quilp in a threatening\\nmanner, as if he doubted whether he might not have been the cause of\\nNelly shedding tears, and felt more than half disposed to revenge the\\nfact upon him on the mere suspicion, turned about and followed his\\nyoung mistress, who had by this time taken her leave of Mrs Quilp and\\ndeparted.', '‘You’re a keen questioner, an’t you, Mrs Quilp?’ said the dwarf,\\nturning upon her as soon as they were left alone.', '‘What more could I do?’ returned his wife mildly.', '‘What more could you do!’ sneered Quilp, ‘couldn’t you have done\\nsomething less?', 'Couldn’t you have done what you had to do, without\\nappearing in your favourite part of the crocodile, you minx?’\\n\\n‘I am very sorry for the child, Quilp,’ said his wife.', '‘Surely I’ve\\ndone enough.', 'I’ve led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were\\nalone; and you were by, God forgive me.’\\n\\n‘You led her on!', 'You did a great deal truly!’ said Quilp.', '‘What did I\\ntell you about making me creak the door?', 'It’s lucky for you that from\\nwhat she let fall, I’ve got the clue I want, for if I hadn’t, I’d have\\nvisited the failure upon you, I can tell you.’\\n\\nMrs Quilp being fully persuaded of this, made no reply.', 'Her husband\\nadded with some exultation,\\n\\n‘But you may thank your fortunate stars--the same stars that made you\\nMrs Quilp--you may thank them that I’m upon the old gentleman’s track,\\nand have got a new light.', 'So let me hear no more about this matter now\\nor at any other time, and don’t get anything too nice for dinner, for I\\nshan’t be home to it.’\\n\\nSo saying, Mr Quilp put his hat on and took himself off, and Mrs Quilp,\\nwho was afflicted beyond measure by the recollection of the part she\\nhad just acted, shut herself up in her chamber, and smothering her head\\nin the bed-clothes bemoaned her fault more bitterly than many less\\ntender-hearted persons would have mourned a much greater offence; for,\\nin the majority of cases, conscience is an elastic and very flexible\\narticle, which will bear a deal of stretching and adapt itself to a\\ngreat variety of circumstances.', 'Some people by prudent management and\\nleaving it off piece by piece like a flannel waistcoat in warm weather,\\neven contrive, in time, to dispense with it altogether; but there be\\nothers who can assume the garment and throw it off at pleasure; and\\nthis, being the greatest and most convenient improvement, is the one\\nmost in vogue.', 'CHAPTER 7\\n\\n‘Fred,’ said Mr Swiveller, ‘remember the once popular melody of Begone\\ndull care; fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of\\nfriendship; and pass the rosy wine.’\\n\\nMr Richard Swiveller’s apartments were in the neighbourhood of Drury\\nLane, and in addition to this convenience of situation had the\\nadvantage of being over a tobacconist’s shop, so that he was enabled to\\nprocure a refreshing sneeze at any time by merely stepping out upon the\\nstaircase, and was saved the trouble and expense of maintaining a\\nsnuff-box.', 'It was in these apartments that Mr Swiveller made use of the\\nexpressions above recorded for the consolation and encouragement of his\\ndesponding friend; and it may not be uninteresting or improper to\\nremark that even these brief observations partook in a double sense of\\nthe figurative and poetical character of Mr Swiveller’s mind, as the\\nrosy wine was in fact represented by one glass of cold gin-and-water,\\nwhich was replenished as occasion required from a bottle and jug upon\\nthe table, and was passed from one to another, in a scarcity of\\ntumblers which, as Mr Swiveller’s was a bachelor’s establishment, may\\nbe acknowledged without a blush.', 'By a like pleasant fiction his single\\nchamber was always mentioned in a plural number.', 'In its disengaged\\ntimes, the tobacconist had announced it in his window as ‘apartments’\\nfor a single gentleman, and Mr Swiveller, following up the hint, never\\nfailed to speak of it as his rooms, his lodgings, or his chambers,\\nconveying to his hearers a notion of indefinite space, and leaving\\ntheir imaginations to wander through long suites of lofty halls, at\\npleasure.', 'In this flight of fancy, Mr Swiveller was assisted by a deceptive piece\\nof furniture, in reality a bedstead, but in semblance a bookcase, which\\noccupied a prominent situation in his chamber and seemed to defy\\nsuspicion and challenge inquiry.', 'There is no doubt that by day Mr\\nSwiveller firmly believed this secret convenience to be a bookcase and\\nnothing more; that he closed his eyes to the bed, resolutely denied the\\nexistence of the blankets, and spurned the bolster from his thoughts.', 'No word of its real use, no hint of its nightly service, no allusion to\\nits peculiar properties, had ever passed between him and his most\\nintimate friends.', 'Implicit faith in the deception was the first article\\nof his creed.', 'To be the friend of Swiveller you must reject all\\ncircumstantial evidence, all reason, observation, and experience, and\\nrepose a blind belief in the bookcase.', 'It was his pet weakness, and he\\ncherished it.', '‘Fred!’ said Mr Swiveller, finding that his former adjuration had been\\nproductive of no effect.', '‘Pass the rosy.’\\n\\nYoung Trent with an impatient gesture pushed the glass towards him, and\\nfell again in the moody attitude from which he had been unwillingly\\nroused.', '‘I’ll give you, Fred,’ said his friend, stirring the mixture, ‘a little\\nsentiment appropriate to the occasion.', 'Here’s May the--’\\n\\n‘Pshaw!’ interposed the other.', '‘You worry me to death with your\\nchattering.', 'You can be merry under any circumstances.’\\n\\n‘Why, Mr Trent,’ returned Dick, ‘there is a proverb which talks about\\nbeing merry and wise.', 'There are some people who can be merry and can’t\\nbe wise, and some who can be wise (or think they can) and can’t be\\nmerry.', 'I’m one of the first sort.', 'If the proverb’s a good ‘un, I\\nsuppose it’s better to keep to half of it than none; at all events, I’d\\nrather be merry and not wise, than like you, neither one nor t’other.’\\n\\n‘Bah!’ muttered his friend, peevishly.', '‘With all my heart,’ said Mr Swiveller.', '‘In the polite circles I\\nbelieve this sort of thing isn’t usually said to a gentleman in his own\\napartments, but never mind that.', 'Make yourself at home,’ adding to this\\nretort an observation to the effect that his friend appeared to be\\nrather ‘cranky’ in point of temper, Richard Swiveller finished the\\nrosy and applied himself to the composition of another glassful, in\\nwhich, after tasting it with great relish, he proposed a toast to an\\nimaginary company.', '‘Gentlemen, I’ll give you, if you please, Success to the ancient family\\nof the Swivellers, and good luck to Mr Richard in particular--Mr\\nRichard, gentlemen,’ said Dick with great emphasis, ‘who spends all his\\nmoney on his friends and is Bah!’d for his pains.', 'Hear, hear!’\\n\\n‘Dick!’ said the other, returning to his seat after having paced the\\nroom twice or thrice, ‘will you talk seriously for two minutes, if I\\nshow you a way to make your fortune with very little trouble?’\\n\\n‘You’ve shown me so many,’ returned Dick; ‘and nothing has come of any\\none of ‘em but empty pockets--’\\n\\n‘You’ll tell a different story of this one, before a very long time is\\nover,’ said his companion, drawing his chair to the table.', '‘You saw my\\nsister Nell?’\\n\\n‘What about her?’ returned Dick.', '‘She has a pretty face, has she not?’\\n\\n‘Why, certainly,’ replied Dick.', '‘I must say for her that there’s not\\nany very strong family likeness between her and you.’\\n\\n‘Has she a pretty face,’ repeated his friend impatiently.', '‘Yes,’ said Dick, ‘she has a pretty face, a very pretty face.', 'What of\\nthat?’\\n\\n‘I’ll tell you,’ returned his friend.', '‘It’s very plain that the old man\\nand I will remain at daggers drawn to the end of our lives, and that I\\nhave nothing to expect from him.', 'You see that, I suppose?’\\n\\n‘A bat might see that, with the sun shining,’ said Dick.', '‘It’s equally plain that the money which the old flint--rot him--first\\ntaught me to expect that I should share with her at his death, will all\\nbe hers, is it not?’\\n\\n‘I should said it was,’ replied Dick; ‘unless the way in which I put\\nthe case to him, made an impression.', 'It may have done so.', 'It was\\npowerful, Fred.', '‘Here is a jolly old grandfather’--that was strong, I\\nthought--very friendly and natural.', 'Did it strike you in that way?’\\n\\n‘It didn’t strike him,’ returned the other, ‘so we needn’t discuss it.', 'Now look here.', 'Nell is nearly fourteen.’\\n\\n‘Fine girl of her age, but small,’ observed Richard Swiveller\\nparenthetically.', '‘If I am to go on, be quiet for one minute,’ returned Trent, fretting\\nat the slight interest the other appeared to take in the conversation.', '‘Now I’m coming to the point.’\\n\\n‘That’s right,’ said Dick.', '‘The girl has strong affections, and brought up as she has been, may,\\nat her age, be easily influenced and persuaded.', 'If I take her in hand,\\nI will be bound by a very little coaxing and threatening to bend her to\\nmy will.', 'Not to beat about the bush (for the advantages of the scheme\\nwould take a week to tell) what’s to prevent your marrying her?’\\n\\nRichard Swiveller, who had been looking over the rim of the tumbler\\nwhile his companion addressed the foregoing remarks to him with great\\nenergy and earnestness of manner, no sooner heard these words than he\\nevinced the utmost consternation, and with difficulty ejaculated the\\nmonosyllable:\\n\\n‘What!’\\n\\n‘I say, what’s to prevent,’ repeated the other with a steadiness of\\nmanner, of the effect of which upon his companion he was well assured\\nby long experience, ‘what’s to prevent your marrying her?’\\n\\n‘And she “nearly fourteen”!’ cried Dick.', '‘I don’t mean marrying her now’--returned the brother angrily; ‘say in\\ntwo year’s time, in three, in four.', 'Does the old man look like a\\nlong-liver?’\\n\\n‘He don’t look like it,’ said Dick shaking his head, ‘but these old\\npeople--there’s no trusting them, Fred.', 'There’s an aunt of mine down in\\nDorsetshire that was going to die when I was eight years old, and\\nhasn’t kept her word yet.', 'They’re so aggravating, so unprincipled, so\\nspiteful--unless there’s apoplexy in the family, Fred, you can’t\\ncalculate upon ‘em, and even then they deceive you just as often as\\nnot.’\\n\\n‘Look at the worst side of the question then,’ said Trent as steadily\\nas before, and keeping his eyes upon his friend.', '‘Suppose he lives.’\\n\\n‘To be sure,’ said Dick.', '‘There’s the rub.’\\n\\n‘I say,’ resumed his friend, ‘suppose he lives, and I persuaded, or if\\nthe word sounds more feasible, forced Nell to a secret marriage with\\nyou.', 'What do you think would come of that?’\\n\\n‘A family and an annual income of nothing, to keep ‘em on,’ said\\nRichard Swiveller after some reflection.', '‘I tell you,’ returned the other with an increased earnestness, which,\\nwhether it were real or assumed, had the same effect on his companion,\\n‘that he lives for her, that his whole energies and thoughts are bound\\nup in her, that he would no more disinherit her for an act of\\ndisobedience than he would take me into his favour again for any act of\\nobedience or virtue that I could possibly be guilty of.', 'He could not do\\nit.', 'You or any other man with eyes in his head may see that, if he\\nchooses.’\\n\\n‘It seems improbable certainly,’ said Dick, musing.', '‘It seems improbable because it is improbable,’ his friend returned.', '‘If you would furnish him with an additional inducement to forgive you,\\nlet there be an irreconcilable breach, a most deadly quarrel, between\\nyou and me--let there be a pretense of such a thing, I mean, of\\ncourse--and he’ll do fast enough.', 'As to Nell, constant dropping will\\nwear away a stone; you know you may trust to me as far as she is\\nconcerned.', 'So, whether he lives or dies, what does it come to?', 'That\\nyou become the sole inheritor of the wealth of this rich old hunks,\\nthat you and I spend it together, and that you get into the bargain a\\nbeautiful young wife.’\\n\\n‘I suppose there’s no doubt about his being rich’--said Dick.', '‘Doubt!', 'Did you hear what he let fall the other day when we were\\nthere?', 'Doubt!', 'What will you doubt next, Dick?’\\n\\nIt would be tedious to pursue the conversation through all its artful\\nwindings, or to develope the gradual approaches by which the heart of\\nRichard Swiveller was gained.', 'It is sufficient to know that vanity,\\ninterest, poverty, and every spendthrift consideration urged him to\\nlook upon the proposal with favour, and that where all other\\ninducements were wanting, the habitual carelessness of his disposition\\nstepped in and still weighed down the scale on the same side.', 'To these\\nimpulses must be added the complete ascendancy which his friend had\\nlong been accustomed to exercise over him--an ascendancy exerted in the\\nbeginning sorely at the expense of his friend’s vices, and was in nine\\ncases out of ten looked upon as his designing tempter when he was\\nindeed nothing but his thoughtless, light-headed tool.', 'The motives on the other side were something deeper than any which\\nRichard Swiveller entertained or understood, but these being left to\\ntheir own development, require no present elucidation.', 'The negotiation\\nwas concluded very pleasantly, and Mr Swiveller was in the act of\\nstating in flowery terms that he had no insurmountable objection to\\nmarrying anybody plentifully endowed with money or moveables, who could\\nbe induced to take him, when he was interrupted in his observations by\\na knock at the door, and the consequent necessity of crying ‘Come in.’\\n\\nThe door was opened, but nothing came in except a soapy arm and a\\nstrong gush of tobacco.', 'The gush of tobacco came from the shop\\ndownstairs, and the soapy arm proceeded from the body of a\\nservant-girl, who being then and there engaged in cleaning the stairs\\nhad just drawn it out of a warm pail to take in a letter, which letter\\nshe now held in her hand, proclaiming aloud with that quick perception\\nof surnames peculiar to her class that it was for Mister Snivelling.', 'Dick looked rather pale and foolish when he glanced at the direction,\\nand still more so when he came to look at the inside, observing that it\\nwas one of the inconveniences of being a lady’s man, and that it was\\nvery easy to talk as they had been talking, but he had quite forgotten\\nher.', '‘Her.', 'Who?’ demanded Trent.', '‘Sophy Wackles,’ said Dick.', '‘Who’s she?’\\n\\n‘She’s all my fancy painted her, sir, that’s what she is,’ said Mr\\nSwiveller, taking a long pull at ‘the rosy’ and looking gravely at his\\nfriend.', '‘She’s lovely, she’s divine.', 'You know her.’\\n\\n‘I remember,’ said his companion carelessly.', '‘What of her?’\\n\\n‘Why, sir,’ returned Dick, ‘between Miss Sophia Wackles and the humble\\nindividual who has now the honor to address you, warm and tender\\nsentiments have been engendered, sentiments of the most honourable and\\ninspiring kind.', 'The Goddess Diana, sir, that calls aloud for the chase,\\nis not more particular in her behavior than Sophia Wackles; I can tell\\nyou that.’\\n\\n‘Am I to believe there’s anything real in what you say?’ demanded his\\nfriend; ‘you don’t mean to say that any love-making has been going on?’\\n\\n‘Love-making, yes.', 'Promising, no,’ said Dick.', '‘There can be no action\\nfor breach, that’s one comfort.', 'I’ve never committed myself in writing,\\nFred.’\\n\\n‘And what’s in the letter, pray?’\\n\\n‘A reminder, Fred, for to-night--a small party of twenty, making two\\nhundred light fantastic toes in all, supposing every lady and gentleman\\nto have the proper complement.', 'I must go, if it’s only to begin\\nbreaking off the affair--I’ll do it, don’t you be afraid.', 'I should like\\nto know whether she left this herself.', 'If she did, unconscious of any\\nbar to her happiness, it’s affecting, Fred.’\\n\\nTo solve this question, Mr Swiveller summoned the handmaid and\\nascertained that Miss Sophy Wackles had indeed left the letter with her\\nown hands; and that she had come accompanied, for decorum’s sake no\\ndoubt, by a younger Miss Wackles; and that on learning that Mr\\nSwiveller was at home and being requested to walk upstairs, she was\\nextremely shocked and professed that she would rather die.', 'Mr Swiveller\\nheard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether\\nconsistent with the project in which he had just concurred, but his\\nfriend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect,\\nprobably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control\\nRichard Swiveller’s proceedings in this or any other matter, whenever\\nhe deemed it necessary, for the advancement of his own purposes, to\\nexert it.', 'CHAPTER 8\\n\\nBusiness disposed of, Mr Swiveller was inwardly reminded of its being\\nnigh dinner-time, and to the intent that his health might not be\\nendangered by longer abstinence, dispatched a message to the nearest\\neating-house requiring an immediate supply of boiled beef and greens\\nfor two.', 'With this demand, however, the eating-house (having experience\\nof its customer) declined to comply, churlishly sending back for answer\\nthat if Mr Swiveller stood in need of beef perhaps he would be so\\nobliging as to come there and eat it, bringing with him, as grace\\nbefore meat, the amount of a certain small account which had long been\\noutstanding.', 'Not at all intimidated by this rebuff, but rather\\nsharpened in wits and appetite, Mr Swiveller forwarded the same message\\nto another and more distant eating-house, adding to it by way of rider\\nthat the gentleman was induced to send so far, not only by the great\\nfame and popularity its beef had acquired, but in consequence of the\\nextreme toughness of the beef retailed at the obdurant cook’s shop,\\nwhich rendered it quite unfit not merely for gentlemanly food, but for\\nany human consumption.', 'The good effect of this politic course was\\ndemonstrated by the speedy arrival of a small pewter pyramid, curiously\\nconstructed of platters and covers, whereof the boiled-beef-plates\\nformed the base, and a foaming quart-pot the apex; the structure being\\nresolved into its component parts afforded all things requisite and\\nnecessary for a hearty meal, to which Mr Swiveller and his friend\\napplied themselves with great keenness and enjoyment.', '‘May the present moment,’ said Dick, sticking his fork into a large\\ncarbuncular potato, ‘be the worst of our lives!', 'I like the plan of\\nsending ‘em with the peel on; there’s a charm in drawing a potato from\\nits native element (if I may so express it) to which the rich and\\npowerful are strangers.', 'Ah!', '“Man wants but little here below, nor wants\\nthat little long!” How true that is!--after dinner.’\\n\\n‘I hope the eating-house keeper will want but little and that he may\\nnot want that little long,’ returned his companion; but I suspect\\nyou’ve no means of paying for this!’\\n\\n‘I shall be passing present, and I’ll call,’ said Dick, winking his eye\\nsignificantly.', '‘The waiter’s quite helpless.', 'The goods are gone, Fred,\\nand there’s an end of it.’\\n\\nIn point of fact, it would seem that the waiter felt this wholesome\\ntruth, for when he returned for the empty plates and dishes and was\\ninformed by Mr Swiveller with dignified carelessness that he would call\\nand settle when he should be passing presently, he displayed some\\nperturbation of spirit and muttered a few remarks about ‘payment on\\ndelivery’ and ‘no trust,’ and other unpleasant subjects, but was fain\\nto content himself with inquiring at what hour it was likely that the\\ngentleman would call, in order that being presently responsible for the\\nbeef, greens, and sundries, he might take to be in the way at the time.', 'Mr Swiveller, after mentally calculating his engagements to a nicety,\\nreplied that he should look in at from two minutes before six and seven\\nminutes past; and the man disappearing with this feeble consolation,\\nRichard Swiveller took a greasy memorandum-book from his pocket and\\nmade an entry therein.', '‘Is that a reminder, in case you should forget to call?’ said Trent\\nwith a sneer.', '‘Not exactly, Fred,’ replied the imperturbable Richard, continuing to\\nwrite with a businesslike air.', '‘I enter in this little book the names\\nof the streets that I can’t go down while the shops are open.', 'This\\ndinner today closes Long Acre.', 'I bought a pair of boots in Great Queen\\nStreet last week, and made that no throughfare too.', 'There’s only one\\navenue to the Strand left often now, and I shall have to stop up that\\nto-night with a pair of gloves.', 'The roads are closing so fast in every\\ndirection, that in a month’s time, unless my aunt sends me a\\nremittance, I shall have to go three or four miles out of town to get\\nover the way.’\\n\\n‘There’s no fear of failing, in the end?’ said Trent.', '‘Why, I hope not,’ returned Mr Swiveller, ‘but the average number of\\nletters it take to soften her is six, and this time we have got as far\\nas eight without any effect at all.', 'I’ll write another to-morrow\\nmorning.', 'I mean to blot it a good deal and shake some water over it out\\nof the pepper-castor to make it look penitent.', '“I’m in such a state of\\nmind that I hardly know what I write”--blot--“if you could see me at\\nthis minute shedding tears for my past misconduct”--pepper-castor--“my\\nhand trembles when I think”--blot again--if that don’t produce the\\neffect, it’s all over.’\\n\\nBy this time, Mr Swiveller had finished his entry, and he now replaced\\nhis pencil in its little sheath and closed the book, in a perfectly\\ngrave and serious frame of mind.', 'His friend discovered that it was time\\nfor him to fulfil some other engagement, and Richard Swiveller was\\naccordingly left alone, in company with the rosy wine and his own\\nmeditations touching Miss Sophy Wackles.', '‘It’s rather sudden,’ said Dick shaking his head with a look of\\ninfinite wisdom, and running on (as he was accustomed to do) with\\nscraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry; ‘when the heart\\nof a man is depressed with fears, the mist is dispelled when Miss\\nWackles appears; she’s a very nice girl.', 'She’s like the red red rose\\nthat’s newly sprung in June--there’s no denying that--she’s also like a\\nmelody that’s sweetly played in tune.', 'It’s really very sudden.', 'Not that\\nthere’s any need, on account of Fred’s little sister, to turn cool\\ndirectly, but its better not to go too far.', 'If I begin to cool at all I\\nmust begin at once, I see that.', 'There’s the chance of an action for\\nbreach, that’s another.', 'There’s the chance of--no, there’s no chance of\\nthat, but it’s as well to be on the safe side.’\\n\\nThis undeveloped was the possibility, which Richard Swiveller sought to\\nconceal even from himself, of his not being proof against the charms of\\nMiss Wackles, and in some unguarded moment, by linking his fortunes to\\nhers forever, of putting it out of his own power to further their\\nnotable scheme to which he had so readily become a party.', 'For all these\\nreasons, he decided to pick a quarrel with Miss Wackles without delay,\\nand casting about for a pretext determined in favour of groundless\\njealousy.', 'Having made up his mind on this important point, he\\ncirculated the glass (from his right hand to left, and back again)\\npretty freely, to enable him to act his part with the greater\\ndiscretion, and then, after making some slight improvements in his\\ntoilet, bent his steps towards the spot hallowed by the fair object of\\nhis meditations.', 'The spot was at Chelsea, for there Miss Sophia Wackles resided with her\\nwidowed mother and two sisters, in conjunction with whom she maintained\\na very small day-school for young ladies of proportionate dimensions; a\\ncircumstance which was made known to the neighbourhood by an oval board\\nover the front first-floor windows, whereupon appeared in circumambient\\nflourishes the words ‘Ladies’ Seminary’; and which was further\\npublished and proclaimed at intervals between the hours of half-past\\nnine and ten in the morning, by a straggling and solitary young lady of\\ntender years standing on the scraper on the tips of her toes and making\\nfutile attempts to reach the knocker with a spelling-book.', 'The several\\nduties of instruction in this establishment were thus discharged.', 'English grammar, composition, geography, and the use of the dumb-bells,\\nby Miss Melissa Wackles; writing, arithmetic, dancing, music, and\\ngeneral fascination, by Miss Sophia Wackles; the art of needle-work,\\nmarking, and samplery, by Miss Jane Wackles; corporal punishment,\\nfasting, and other tortures and terrors, by Mrs Wackles.', 'Miss Melissa\\nWackles was the eldest daughter, Miss Sophy the next, and Miss Jane the\\nyoungest.', 'Miss Melissa might have seen five-and-thirty summers or\\nthereabouts, and verged on the autumnal; Miss Sophy was a fresh, good\\nhumoured, buxom girl of twenty; and Miss Jane numbered scarcely sixteen\\nyears.', 'Mrs Wackles was an excellent but rather venomous old lady of\\nthree-score.', 'To this Ladies’ Seminary, then, Richard Swiveller hied, with designs\\nobnoxious to the peace of the fair Sophia, who, arrayed in virgin\\nwhite, embellished by no ornament but one blushing rose, received him\\non his arrival, in the midst of very elegant not to say brilliant\\npreparations; such as the embellishment of the room with the little\\nflower-pots which always stood on the window-sill outside, save in\\nwindy weather when they blew into the area; the choice attire of the\\nday-scholars who were allowed to grace the festival; the unwonted curls\\nof Miss Jane Wackles who had kept her head during the whole of the\\npreceding day screwed up tight in a yellow play-bill; and the solemn\\ngentility and stately bearing of the old lady and her eldest daughter,\\nwhich struck Mr Swiveller as being uncommon but made no further\\nimpression upon him.', 'The truth is--and, as there is no accounting for tastes, even a taste\\nso strange as this may be recorded without being looked upon as a\\nwilful and malicious invention--the truth is that neither Mrs Wackles\\nnor her eldest daughter had at any time greatly favoured the\\npretensions of Mr Swiveller, being accustomed to make slight mention of\\nhim as ‘a gay young man’ and to sigh and shake their heads ominously\\nwhenever his name was mentioned.', 'Mr Swiveller’s conduct in respect to\\nMiss Sophy having been of that vague and dilatory kind which is usually\\nlooked upon as betokening no fixed matrimonial intentions, the young\\nlady herself began in course of time to deem it highly desirable, that\\nit should be brought to an issue one way or other.', 'Hence she had at\\nlast consented to play off against Richard Swiveller a stricken\\nmarket-gardner known to be ready with his offer on the smallest\\nencouragement, and hence--as this occasion had been specially assigned\\nfor the purpose--that great anxiety on her part for Richard Swiveller’s\\npresence which had occasioned her to leave the note he has been seen to\\nreceive.', '‘If he has any expectations at all or any means of keeping a\\nwife well,’ said Mrs Wackles to her eldest daughter, ‘he’ll state ‘em\\nto us now or never.’--‘If he really cares about me,’ thought Miss\\nSophy, ‘he must tell me so, to-night.’\\n\\nBut all these sayings and doings and thinkings being unknown to Mr\\nSwiveller, affected him not in the least; he was debating in his mind\\nhow he could best turn jealous, and wishing that Sophy were for that\\noccasion only far less pretty than she was, or that she were her own\\nsister, which would have served his turn as well, when the company\\ncame, and among them the market-gardener, whose name was Cheggs.', 'But Mr\\nCheggs came not alone or unsupported, for he prudently brought along\\nwith him his sister, Miss Cheggs, who making straight to Miss Sophy and\\ntaking her by both hands, and kissing her on both cheeks, hoped in an\\naudible whisper that they had not come too early.', '‘Too early, no!’ replied Miss Sophy.', '‘Oh, my dear,’ rejoined Miss Cheggs in the same whisper as before,\\n‘I’ve been so tormented, so worried, that it’s a mercy we were not here\\nat four o’clock in the afternoon.', 'Alick has been in such a state of\\nimpatience to come!', 'You’d hardly believe that he was dressed before\\ndinner-time and has been looking at the clock and teasing me ever\\nsince.', 'It’s all your fault, you naughty thing.’\\n\\nHereupon Miss Sophy blushed, and Mr Cheggs (who was bashful before\\nladies) blushed too, and Miss Sophy’s mother and sisters, to prevent Mr\\nCheggs from blushing more, lavished civilities and attentions upon him,\\nand left Richard Swiveller to take care of himself.', 'Here was the very\\nthing he wanted, here was good cause reason and foundation for\\npretending to be angry; but having this cause reason and foundation\\nwhich he had come expressly to seek, not expecting to find, Richard\\nSwiveller was angry in sound earnest, and wondered what the devil\\nCheggs meant by his impudence.', 'However, Mr Swiveller had Miss Sophy’s hand for the first quadrille\\n(country-dances being low, were utterly proscribed) and so gained an\\nadvantage over his rival, who sat despondingly in a corner and\\ncontemplated the glorious figure of the young lady as she moved through\\nthe mazy dance.', 'Nor was this the only start Mr Swiveller had of the\\nmarket-gardener, for determining to show the family what quality of man\\nthey trifled with, and influenced perhaps by his late libations, he\\nperformed such feats of agility and such spins and twirls as filled the\\ncompany with astonishment, and in particular caused a very long\\ngentleman who was dancing with a very short scholar, to stand quite\\ntransfixed by wonder and admiration.', 'Even Mrs Wackles forgot for the\\nmoment to snub three small young ladies who were inclined to be happy,\\nand could not repress a rising thought that to have such a dancer as\\nthat in the family would be a pride indeed.', 'At this momentous crisis, Miss Cheggs proved herself a vigourous and\\nuseful ally, for not confining herself to expressing by scornful smiles\\na contempt for Mr Swiveller’s accomplishments, she took every\\nopportunity of whispering into Miss Sophy’s ear expressions of\\ncondolence and sympathy on her being worried by such a ridiculous\\ncreature, declaring that she was frightened to death lest Alick should\\nfall upon, and beat him, in the fulness of his wrath, and entreating\\nMiss Sophy to observe how the eyes of the said Alick gleamed with love\\nand fury; passions, it may be observed, which being too much for his\\neyes rushed into his nose also, and suffused it with a crimson glow.', '‘You must dance with Miss Cheggs,’ said Miss Sophy to Dick Swiviller,\\nafter she had herself danced twice with Mr Cheggs and made great show\\nof encouraging his advances.', '‘She’s a nice girl--and her brother’s\\nquite delightful.’\\n\\n‘Quite delightful, is he?’ muttered Dick.', '‘Quite delighted too, I\\nshould say, from the manner in which he’s looking this way.’\\n\\nHere Miss Jane (previously instructed for the purpose) interposed her\\nmany curls and whispered her sister to observe how jealous Mr Cheggs\\nwas.', '‘Jealous!', 'Like his impudence!’ said Richard Swiviller.', '‘His impudence, Mr Swiviller!’ said Miss Jane, tossing her head.', '‘Take\\ncare he don’t hear you, sir, or you may be sorry for it.’\\n\\n‘Oh, pray, Jane--’ said Miss Sophy.', '‘Nonsense!’ replied her sister.', '‘Why shouldn’t Mr Cheggs be jealous if\\nhe likes?', 'I like that, certainly.', 'Mr Cheggs has a good a right to be\\njealous as anyone else has, and perhaps he may have a better right soon\\nif he hasn’t already.', 'You know best about that, Sophy!’\\n\\nThough this was a concerted plot between Miss Sophy and her sister,\\noriginating in humane intentions and having for its object the inducing\\nMr Swiviller to declare himself in time, it failed in its effect; for\\nMiss Jane being one of those young ladies who are prematurely shrill\\nand shrewish, gave such undue importance to her part that Mr Swiviller\\nretired in dudgeon, resigning his mistress to Mr Cheggs and conveying a\\ndefiance into his looks which that gentleman indignantly returned.', '‘Did you speak to me, sir?’ said Mr Cheggs, following him into a\\ncorner.', '‘Have the kindness to smile, sir, in order that we may not be\\nsuspected.', 'Did you speak to me, sir’?', 'Mr Swiviller looked with a supercilious smile at Mr Chegg’s toes, then\\nraised his eyes from them to his ankles, from that to his shin, from\\nthat to his knee, and so on very gradually, keeping up his right leg,\\nuntil he reached his waistcoat, when he raised his eyes from button to\\nbutton until he reached his chin, and travelling straight up the middle\\nof his nose came at last to his eyes, when he said abruptly,\\n\\n‘No, sir, I didn’t.’\\n\\n‘’Hem!’ said Mr Cheggs, glancing over his shoulder, ‘have the goodness\\nto smile again, sir.', 'Perhaps you wished to speak to me, sir.’\\n\\n‘No, sir, I didn’t do that, either.’\\n\\n‘Perhaps you may have nothing to say to me now, sir,’ said Mr Cheggs\\nfiercely.', 'At these words Richard Swiviller withdrew his eyes from Mr Chegg’s\\nface, and travelling down the middle of his nose and down his waistcoat\\nand down his right leg, reached his toes again, and carefully surveyed\\nhim; this done, he crossed over, and coming up the other leg, and\\nthence approaching by the waistcoat as before, said when had got to his\\neyes, ‘No sir, I haven’t.’\\n\\n‘Oh, indeed, sir!’ said Mr Cheggs.', '‘I’m glad to hear it.', 'You know where\\nI’m to be found, I suppose, sir, in case you should have anything to\\nsay to me?’\\n\\n‘I can easily inquire, sir, when I want to know.’\\n\\n‘There’s nothing more we need say, I believe, sir?’\\n\\n‘Nothing more, sir’--With that they closed the tremendous dialog by\\nfrowning mutually.', 'Mr Cheggs hastened to tender his hand to Miss Sophy,\\nand Mr Swiviller sat himself down in a corner in a very moody state.', 'Hard by this corner, Mrs Wackles and Miss Wackles were seated, looking\\non at the dance; and unto Mrs and Miss Wackles, Miss Cheggs\\noccasionally darted when her partner was occupied with his share of the\\nfigure, and made some remark or other which was gall and wormwood to\\nRichard Swiviller’s soul.', 'Looking into the eyes of Mrs and Miss Wackles\\nfor encouragement, and sitting very upright and uncomfortable on a\\ncouple of hard stools, were two of the day-scholars; and when Miss\\nWackles smiled, and Mrs Wackles smiled, the two little girls on the\\nstools sought to curry favour by smiling likewise, in gracious\\nacknowledgement of which attention the old lady frowned them down\\ninstantly, and said that if they dared to be guilty of such an\\nimpertinence again, they should be sent under convoy to their\\nrespective homes.', 'This threat caused one of the young ladies, she being\\nof a weak and trembling temperament, to shed tears, and for this\\noffense they were both filed off immediately, with a dreadful\\npromptitude that struck terror into the souls of all the pupils.', '‘I’ve got such news for you,’ said Miss Cheggs approaching once more,\\n‘Alick has been saying such things to Sophy.', 'Upon my word, you know,\\nit’s quite serious and in earnest, that’s clear.’\\n\\n‘What’s he been saying, my dear?’ demanded Mrs Wackles.', '‘All manner of things,’ replied Miss Cheggs, ‘you can’t think how out\\nhe has been speaking!’\\n\\nRichard Swiviller considered it advisable to hear no more, but taking\\nadvantage of a pause in the dancing, and the approach of Mr Cheggs to\\npay his court to the old lady, swaggered with an extremely careful\\nassumption of extreme carelessness toward the door, passing on the way\\nMiss Jane Wackles, who in all the glory of her curls was holding a\\nflirtation, (as good practice when no better was to be had) with a\\nfeeble old gentleman who lodged in the parlour.', 'Near the door sat Miss\\nSophy, still fluttered and confused by the attentions of Mr Cheggs, and\\nby her side Richard Swiveller lingered for a moment to exchange a few\\nparting words.', '‘My boat is on the shore and my bark is on the sea, but before I pass\\nthis door I will say farewell to thee,’ murmured Dick, looking gloomily\\nupon her.', '‘Are you going?’ said Miss Sophy, whose heart sank within her at the\\nresult of her stratagem, but who affected a light indifference\\nnotwithstanding.', '‘Am I going!’ echoed Dick bitterly.', '‘Yes, I am.', 'What then?’\\n\\n‘Nothing, except that it’s very early,’ said Miss Sophy; ‘but you are\\nyour own master, of course.’\\n\\n‘I would that I had been my own mistress too,’ said Dick, ‘before I had\\never entertained a thought of you.', 'Miss Wackles, I believed you true,\\nand I was blest in so believing, but now I mourn that e’er I knew, a\\ngirl so fair yet so deceiving.’\\n\\nMiss Sophy bit her lip and affected to look with great interest after\\nMr Cheggs, who was quaffing lemonade in the distance.', '‘I came here,’ said Dick, rather oblivious of the purpose with which he\\nhad really come, ‘with my bosom expanded, my heart dilated, and my\\nsentiments of a corresponding description.', 'I go away with feelings that\\nmay be conceived but cannot be described, feeling within myself that\\ndesolating truth that my best affections have experienced this night a\\nstifler!’\\n\\n‘I am sure I don’t know what you mean, Mr Swiviller,’ said Miss Sophy\\nwith downcast eyes.', '‘I’m very sorry if--’\\n\\n‘Sorry, Ma’am!’ said Dick, ‘sorry in the possession of a Cheggs!', 'But I\\nwish you a very good night, concluding with this slight remark, that\\nthere is a young lady growing up at this present moment for me, who has\\nnot only great personal attractions but great wealth, and who has\\nrequested her next of kin to propose for my hand, which, having a\\nregard for some members of her family, I have consented to promise.', 'It’s a gratifying circumstance which you’ll be glad to hear, that a\\nyoung and lovely girl is growing into a woman expressly on my account,\\nand is now saving up for me.', 'I thought I’d mention it.', 'I have now\\nmerely to apologize for trespassing so long upon your attention.', 'Good\\nnight.’\\n\\n‘There’s one good thing springs out of all this,’ said Richard\\nSwiviller to himself when he had reached home and was hanging over the\\ncandle with the extinguisher in his hand, ‘which is, that I now go\\nheart and soul, neck and heels, with Fred in all his scheme about\\nlittle Nelly, and right glad he’ll be to find me so strong upon it.', 'He\\nshall know all about that to-morrow, and in the meantime, as it’s\\nrather late, I’ll try and get a wink of the balmy.’\\n\\n‘The balmy’ came almost as soon as it was courted.', 'In a very few\\nminutes Mr Swiviller was fast asleep, dreaming that he had married\\nNelly Trent and come into the property, and that his first act of power\\nwas to lay waste the market-garden of Mr Cheggs and turn it into a\\nbrick-field.', 'CHAPTER 9\\n\\nThe child, in her confidence with Mrs Quilp, had but feebly described\\nthe sadness and sorrow of her thoughts, or the heaviness of the cloud\\nwhich overhung her home, and cast dark shadows on its hearth.', 'Besides\\nthat it was very difficult to impart to any person not intimately\\nacquainted with the life she led, an adequate sense of its gloom and\\nloneliness, a constant fear of in some way committing or injuring the\\nold man to whom she was so tenderly attached, had restrained her, even\\nin the midst of her heart’s overflowing, and made her timid of allusion\\nto the main cause of her anxiety and distress.', 'For, it was not the monotonous days unchequered by variety and\\nuncheered by pleasant companionship, it was not the dark dreary\\nevenings or the long solitary nights, it was not the absence of every\\nslight and easy pleasure for which young hearts beat high, or the\\nknowing nothing of childhood but its weakness and its easily wounded\\nspirit, that had wrung such tears from Nell.', 'To see the old man struck\\ndown beneath the pressure of some hidden grief, to mark his wavering\\nand unsettled state, to be agitated at times with a dreadful fear that\\nhis mind was wandering, and to trace in his words and looks the dawning\\nof despondent madness; to watch and wait and listen for confirmation of\\nthese things day after day, and to feel and know that, come what might,\\nthey were alone in the world with no one to help or advise or care\\nabout them--these were causes of depression and anxiety that might have\\nsat heavily on an older breast with many influences at work to cheer\\nand gladden it, but how heavily on the mind of a young child to whom\\nthey were ever present, and who was constantly surrounded by all that\\ncould keep such thoughts in restless action!', 'And yet, to the old man’s vision, Nell was still the same.', 'When he\\ncould, for a moment, disengage his mind from the phantom that haunted\\nand brooded on it always, there was his young companion with the same\\nsmile for him, the same earnest words, the same merry laugh, the same\\nlove and care that, sinking deep into his soul, seemed to have been\\npresent to him through his whole life.', 'And so he went on, content to\\nread the book of her heart from the page first presented to him, little\\ndreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves, and\\nmurmuring within himself that at least the child was happy.', 'She had been once.', 'She had gone singing through the dim rooms, and\\nmoving with gay and lightsome step among their dusty treasures, making\\nthem older by her young life, and sterner and more grim by her gay and\\ncheerful presence.', 'But, now, the chambers were cold and gloomy, and\\nwhen she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours, and\\nsat in one of them, she was still and motionless as their inanimate\\noccupants, and had no heart to startle the echoes--hoarse from their\\nlong silence--with her voice.', 'In one of these rooms, was a window looking into the street, where the\\nchild sat, many and many a long evening, and often far into the night,\\nalone and thoughtful.', 'None are so anxious as those who watch and wait;\\nat these times, mournful fancies came flocking on her mind, in crowds.', 'She would take her station here, at dusk, and watch the people as they\\npassed up and down the street, or appeared at the windows of the\\nopposite houses; wondering whether those rooms were as lonesome as that\\nin which she sat, and whether those people felt it company to see her\\nsitting there, as she did only to see them look out and draw in their\\nheads again.', 'There was a crooked stack of chimneys on one of the\\nroofs, in which, by often looking at them, she had fancied ugly faces\\nthat were frowning over at her and trying to peer into the room; and\\nshe felt glad when it grew too dark to make them out, though she was\\nsorry too, when the man came to light the lamps in the street--for it\\nmade it late, and very dull inside.', 'Then, she would draw in her head\\nto look round the room and see that everything was in its place and\\nhadn’t moved; and looking out into the street again, would perhaps see\\na man passing with a coffin on his back, and two or three others\\nsilently following him to a house where somebody lay dead; which made\\nher shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the\\nold man’s altered face and manner, and a new train of fears and\\nspeculations.', 'If he were to die--if sudden illness had happened to\\nhim, and he were never to come home again, alive--if, one night, he\\nshould come home, and kiss and bless her as usual, and after she had\\ngone to bed and had fallen asleep and was perhaps dreaming pleasantly,\\nand smiling in her sleep, he should kill himself and his blood come\\ncreeping, creeping, on the ground to her own bed-room door!', 'These\\nthoughts were too terrible to dwell upon, and again she would have\\nrecourse to the street, now trodden by fewer feet, and darker and more\\nsilent than before.', 'The shops were closing fast, and lights began to\\nshine from the upper windows, as the neighbours went to bed.', 'By\\ndegrees, these dwindled away and disappeared or were replaced, here and\\nthere, by a feeble rush-candle which was to burn all night.', 'Still,\\nthere was one late shop at no great distance which sent forth a ruddy\\nglare upon the pavement even yet, and looked bright and companionable.', 'But, in a little time, this closed, the light was extinguished, and all\\nwas gloomy and quiet, except when some stray footsteps sounded on the\\npavement, or a neighbour, out later than his wont, knocked lustily at\\nhis house-door to rouse the sleeping inmates.', 'When the night had worn away thus far (and seldom now until it had) the\\nchild would close the window, and steal softly down stairs, thinking as\\nshe went that if one of those hideous faces below, which often mingled\\nwith her dreams, were to meet her by the way, rendering itself visible\\nby some strange light of its own, how terrified she would be.', 'But\\nthese fears vanished before a well-trimmed lamp and the familiar aspect\\nof her own room.', 'After praying fervently, and with many bursting\\ntears, for the old man, and the restoration of his peace of mind and\\nthe happiness they had once enjoyed, she would lay her head upon the\\npillow and sob herself to sleep: often starting up again, before the\\nday-light came, to listen for the bell and respond to the imaginary\\nsummons which had roused her from her slumber.', 'One night, the third after Nelly’s interview with Mrs Quilp, the old\\nman, who had been weak and ill all day, said he should not leave home.', 'The child’s eyes sparkled at the intelligence, but her joy subsided\\nwhen they reverted to his worn and sickly face.', '‘Two days,’ he said, ‘two whole, clear, days have passed, and there is\\nno reply.', 'What did he tell thee, Nell?’\\n\\n‘Exactly what I told you, dear grandfather, indeed.’\\n\\n‘True,’ said the old man, faintly.', '‘Yes.', 'But tell me again, Nell.', 'My\\nhead fails me.', 'What was it that he told thee?', 'Nothing more than that\\nhe would see me to-morrow or next day?', 'That was in the note.’\\n\\n‘Nothing more,’ said the child.', '‘Shall I go to him again to-morrow,\\ndear grandfather?', 'Very early?', 'I will be there and back, before\\nbreakfast.’\\n\\nThe old man shook his head, and sighing mournfully, drew her towards\\nhim.', '‘’Twould be of no use, my dear, no earthly use.', 'But if he deserts me,\\nNell, at this moment--if he deserts me now, when I should, with his\\nassistance, be recompensed for all the time and money I have lost, and\\nall the agony of mind I have undergone, which makes me what you see, I\\nam ruined, and--worse, far worse than that--have ruined thee, for whom\\nI ventured all.', 'If we are beggars--!’\\n\\n‘What if we are?’ said the child boldly.', '‘Let us be beggars, and be\\nhappy.’\\n\\n‘Beggars--and happy!’ said the old man.', '‘Poor child!’\\n\\n‘Dear grandfather,’ cried the girl with an energy which shone in her\\nflushed face, trembling voice, and impassioned gesture, ‘I am not a\\nchild in that I think, but even if I am, oh hear me pray that we may\\nbeg, or work in open roads or fields, to earn a scanty living, rather\\nthan live as we do now.’\\n\\n‘Nelly!’ said the old man.', '‘Yes, yes, rather than live as we do now,’ the child repeated, more\\nearnestly than before.', '‘If you are sorrowful, let me know why and be\\nsorrowful too; if you waste away and are paler and weaker every day,\\nlet me be your nurse and try to comfort you.', 'If you are poor, let us\\nbe poor together; but let me be with you, do let me be with you; do not\\nlet me see such change and not know why, or I shall break my heart and\\ndie.', 'Dear grandfather, let us leave this sad place to-morrow, and beg\\nour way from door to door.’\\n\\nThe old man covered his face with his hands, and hid it in the pillow\\nof the couch on which he lay.', '‘Let us be beggars,’ said the child passing an arm round his neck, ‘I\\nhave no fear but we shall have enough, I am sure we shall.', 'Let us walk\\nthrough country places, and sleep in fields and under trees, and never\\nthink of money again, or anything that can make you sad, but rest at\\nnights, and have the sun and wind upon our faces in the day, and thank\\nGod together!', 'Let us never set foot in dark rooms or melancholy\\nhouses, any more, but wander up and down wherever we like to go; and\\nwhen you are tired, you shall stop to rest in the pleasantest place\\nthat we can find, and I will go and beg for both.’\\n\\nThe child’s voice was lost in sobs as she dropped upon the old man’s\\nneck; nor did she weep alone.', 'These were not words for other ears, nor was it a scene for other eyes.', 'And yet other ears and eyes were there and greedily taking in all that\\npassed, and moreover they were the ears and eyes of no less a person\\nthan Mr Daniel Quilp, who, having entered unseen when the child first\\nplaced herself at the old man’s side, refrained--actuated, no doubt, by\\nmotives of the purest delicacy--from interrupting the conversation, and\\nstood looking on with his accustomed grin.', 'Standing, however, being a\\ntiresome attitude to a gentleman already fatigued with walking, and the\\ndwarf being one of that kind of persons who usually make themselves at\\nhome, he soon cast his eyes upon a chair, into which he skipped with\\nuncommon agility, and perching himself on the back with his feet upon\\nthe seat, was thus enabled to look on and listen with greater comfort\\nto himself, besides gratifying at the same time that taste for doing\\nsomething fantastic and monkey-like, which on all occasions had strong\\npossession of him.', 'Here, then, he sat, one leg cocked carelessly over\\nthe other, his chin resting on the palm of his hand, his head turned a\\nlittle on one side, and his ugly features twisted into a complacent\\ngrimace.', 'And in this position the old man, happening in course of time\\nto look that way, at length chanced to see him: to his unbounded\\nastonishment.', 'The child uttered a suppressed shriek on beholding this agreeable\\nfigure; in their first surprise both she and the old man, not knowing\\nwhat to say, and half doubting its reality, looked shrinkingly at it.', 'Not at all disconcerted by this reception, Daniel Quilp preserved the\\nsame attitude, merely nodding twice or thrice with great condescension.', 'At length, the old man pronounced his name, and inquired how he came\\nthere.', '‘Through the door,’ said Quilp pointing over his shoulder with his\\nthumb.', '‘I’m not quite small enough to get through key-holes.', 'I wish I\\nwas.', 'I want to have some talk with you, particularly, and in private.', 'With nobody present, neighbour.', 'Good-bye, little Nelly.’\\n\\nNell looked at the old man, who nodded to her to retire, and kissed her\\ncheek.', '‘Ah!’ said the dwarf, smacking his lips, ‘what a nice kiss that\\nwas--just upon the rosy part.', 'What a capital kiss!’\\n\\nNell was none the slower in going away, for this remark.', 'Quilp looked\\nafter her with an admiring leer, and when she had closed the door, fell\\nto complimenting the old man upon her charms.', '‘Such a fresh, blooming, modest little bud, neighbour,’ said Quilp,\\nnursing his short leg, and making his eyes twinkle very much; ‘such a\\nchubby, rosy, cosy, little Nell!’\\n\\nThe old man answered by a forced smile, and was plainly struggling with\\na feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience.', 'It was not\\nlost upon Quilp, who delighted in torturing him, or indeed anybody\\nelse, when he could.', '‘She’s so,’ said Quilp, speaking very slowly, and feigning to be quite\\nabsorbed in the subject, ‘so small, so compact, so beautifully\\nmodelled, so fair, with such blue veins and such a transparent skin,\\nand such little feet, and such winning ways--but bless me, you’re\\nnervous!', 'Why neighbour, what’s the matter?', 'I swear to you,’ continued\\nthe dwarf dismounting from the chair and sitting down in it, with a\\ncareful slowness of gesture very different from the rapidity with which\\nhe had sprung up unheard, ‘I swear to you that I had no idea old blood\\nran so fast or kept so warm.', 'I thought it was sluggish in its course,\\nand cool, quite cool.', 'I am pretty sure it ought to be.', 'Yours must be\\nout of order, neighbour.’\\n\\n‘I believe it is,’ groaned the old man, clasping his head with both\\nhands.', '‘There’s burning fever here, and something now and then to\\nwhich I fear to give a name.’\\n\\nThe dwarf said never a word, but watched his companion as he paced\\nrestlessly up and down the room, and presently returned to his seat.', 'Here he remained, with his head bowed upon his breast for some time,\\nand then suddenly raising it, said,\\n\\n‘Once, and once for all, have you brought me any money?’\\n\\n‘No!’ returned Quilp.', '‘Then,’ said the old man, clenching his hands desperately, and looking\\nupwards, ‘the child and I are lost!’\\n\\n‘Neighbour,’ said Quilp glancing sternly at him, and beating his hand\\ntwice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention, ‘let\\nme be plain with you, and play a fairer game than when you held all the\\ncards, and I saw but the backs and nothing more.', 'You have no secret\\nfrom me now.’\\n\\nThe old man looked up, trembling.', '‘You are surprised,’ said Quilp.', '‘Well, perhaps that’s natural.', 'You\\nhave no secret from me now, I say; no, not one.', 'For now, I know, that\\nall those sums of money, that all those loans, advances, and supplies\\nthat you have had from me, have found their way to--shall I say the\\nword?’\\n\\n‘Aye!’ replied the old man, ‘say it, if you will.’\\n\\n‘To the gaming-table,’ rejoined Quilp, ‘your nightly haunt.', 'This was\\nthe precious scheme to make your fortune, was it; this was the secret\\ncertain source of wealth in which I was to have sunk my money (if I had\\nbeen the fool you took me for); this was your inexhaustible mine of\\ngold, your El Dorado, eh?’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ cried the old man, turning upon him with gleaming eyes, ‘it was.', 'It is.', 'It will be, till I die.’\\n\\n‘That I should have been blinded,’ said Quilp looking contemptuously at\\nhim, ‘by a mere shallow gambler!’\\n\\n‘I am no gambler,’ cried the old man fiercely.', '‘I call Heaven to\\nwitness that I never played for gain of mine, or love of play; that at\\nevery piece I staked, I whispered to myself that orphan’s name and\\ncalled on Heaven to bless the venture;--which it never did.', 'Whom did\\nit prosper?', 'Who were those with whom I played?', 'Men who lived by\\nplunder, profligacy, and riot; squandering their gold in doing ill, and\\npropagating vice and evil.', 'My winnings would have been from them, my\\nwinnings would have been bestowed to the last farthing on a young\\nsinless child whose life they would have sweetened and made happy.', 'What would they have contracted?', 'The means of corruption,\\nwretchedness, and misery.', 'Who would not have hoped in such a cause?', 'Tell me that!', 'Who would not have hoped as I did?’\\n\\n‘When did you first begin this mad career?’ asked Quilp, his taunting\\ninclination subdued, for a moment, by the old man’s grief and wildness.', '‘When did I first begin?’ he rejoined, passing his hand across his\\nbrow.', '‘When was it, that I first began?', 'When should it be, but when I\\nbegan to think how little I had saved, how long a time it took to save\\nat all, how short a time I might have at my age to live, and how she\\nwould be left to the rough mercies of the world, with barely enough to\\nkeep her from the sorrows that wait on poverty; then it was that I\\nbegan to think about it.’\\n\\n‘After you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to\\nsea?’ said Quilp.', '‘Shortly after that,’ replied the old man.', '‘I thought of it a long\\ntime, and had it in my sleep for months.', 'Then I began.', 'I found no\\npleasure in it, I expected none.', 'What has it ever brought me but\\nanxious days and sleepless nights; but loss of health and peace of\\nmind, and gain of feebleness and sorrow!’\\n\\n‘You lost what money you had laid by, first, and then came to me.', 'While I thought you were making your fortune (as you said you were) you\\nwere making yourself a beggar, eh?', 'Dear me!', 'And so it comes to pass\\nthat I hold every security you could scrape together, and a bill of\\nsale upon the--upon the stock and property,’ said Quilp standing up and\\nlooking about him, as if to assure himself that none of it had been\\ntaken away.', '‘But did you never win?’\\n\\n‘Never!’ groaned the old man.', '‘Never won back my loss!’\\n\\n‘I thought,’ sneered the dwarf, ‘that if a man played long enough he\\nwas sure to win at last, or, at the worst, not to come off a loser.’\\n\\n‘And so he is,’ cried the old man, suddenly rousing himself from his\\nstate of despondency, and lashed into the most violent excitement, ‘so\\nhe is; I have felt that from the first, I have always known it, I’ve\\nseen it, I never felt it half so strongly as I feel it now.', 'Quilp, I\\nhave dreamed, three nights, of winning the same large sum, I never\\ncould dream that dream before, though I have often tried.', 'Do not\\ndesert me, now I have this chance.', 'I have no resource but you, give me\\nsome help, let me try this one last hope.’\\n\\nThe dwarf shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.', '‘See, Quilp, good tender-hearted Quilp,’ said the old man, drawing some\\nscraps of paper from his pocket with a trembling hand, and clasping the\\ndwarf’s arm, ‘only see here.', 'Look at these figures, the result of long\\ncalculation, and painful and hard experience.', 'I MUST win.', 'I only want\\na little help once more, a few pounds, but two score pounds, dear\\nQuilp.’\\n\\n‘The last advance was seventy,’ said the dwarf; ‘and it went in one\\nnight.’\\n\\n‘I know it did,’ answered the old man, ‘but that was the very worst\\nfortune of all, and the time had not come then.', 'Quilp, consider,\\nconsider,’ the old man cried, trembling so much the while, that the\\npapers in his hand fluttered as if they were shaken by the wind, ‘that\\norphan child!', 'If I were alone, I could die with gladness--perhaps even\\nanticipate that doom which is dealt out so unequally: coming, as it\\ndoes, on the proud and happy in their strength, and shunning the needy\\nand afflicted, and all who court it in their despair--but what I have\\ndone, has been for her.', 'Help me for her sake I implore you; not for\\nmine; for hers!’\\n\\n‘I’m sorry I’ve got an appointment in the city,’ said Quilp, looking at\\nhis watch with perfect self-possession, ‘or I should have been very\\nglad to have spent half an hour with you while you composed yourself,\\nvery glad.’\\n\\n‘Nay, Quilp, good Quilp,’ gasped the old man, catching at his skirts,\\n‘you and I have talked together, more than once, of her poor mother’s\\nstory.', 'The fear of her coming to poverty has perhaps been bred in me\\nby that.', 'Do not be hard upon me, but take that into account.', 'You are\\na great gainer by me.', 'Oh spare me the money for this one last hope!’\\n\\n‘I couldn’t do it really,’ said Quilp with unusual politeness, ‘though\\nI tell you what--and this is a circumstance worth bearing in mind as\\nshowing how the sharpest among us may be taken in sometimes--I was so\\ndeceived by the penurious way in which you lived, alone with Nelly--’\\n\\n‘All done to save money for tempting fortune, and to make her triumph\\ngreater,’ cried the old man.', '‘Yes, yes, I understand that now,’ said Quilp; ‘but I was going to say,\\nI was so deceived by that, your miserly way, the reputation you had\\namong those who knew you of being rich, and your repeated assurances\\nthat you would make of my advances treble and quadruple the interest\\nyou paid me, that I’d have advanced you, even now, what you want, on\\nyour simple note of hand, if I hadn’t unexpectedly become acquainted\\nwith your secret way of life.’\\n\\n‘Who is it,’ retorted the old man desperately, ‘that, notwithstanding\\nall my caution, told you?', 'Come.', 'Let me know the name--the person.’\\n\\nThe crafty dwarf, bethinking himself that his giving up the child would\\nlead to the disclosure of the artifice he had employed, which, as\\nnothing was to be gained by it, it was well to conceal, stopped short\\nin his answer and said, ‘Now, who do you think?’\\n\\n‘It was Kit, it must have been the boy; he played the spy, and you\\ntampered with him?’ said the old man.', '‘How came you to think of him?’ said the dwarf in a tone of great\\ncommiseration.', '‘Yes, it was Kit.', 'Poor Kit!’\\n\\nSo saying, he nodded in a friendly manner, and took his leave: stopping\\nwhen he had passed the outer door a little distance, and grinning with\\nextraordinary delight.', '‘Poor Kit!’ muttered Quilp.', '‘I think it was Kit who said I was an\\nuglier dwarf than could be seen anywhere for a penny, wasn’t it.', 'Ha ha\\nha!', 'Poor Kit!’\\n\\nAnd with that he went his way, still chuckling as he went.', 'CHAPTER 10\\n\\nDaniel Quilp neither entered nor left the old man’s house, unobserved.', 'In the shadow of an archway nearly opposite, leading to one of the many\\npassages which diverged from the main street, there lingered one, who,\\nhaving taken up his position when the twilight first came on, still\\nmaintained it with undiminished patience, and leaning against the wall\\nwith the manner of a person who had a long time to wait, and being well\\nused to it was quite resigned, scarcely changed his attitude for the\\nhour together.', 'This patient lounger attracted little attention from any of those who\\npassed, and bestowed as little upon them.', 'His eyes were constantly\\ndirected towards one object; the window at which the child was\\naccustomed to sit.', 'If he withdrew them for a moment, it was only to\\nglance at a clock in some neighbouring shop, and then to strain his\\nsight once more in the old quarter with increased earnestness and\\nattention.', 'It had been remarked that this personage evinced no weariness in his\\nplace of concealment; nor did he, long as his waiting was.', 'But as the\\ntime went on, he manifested some anxiety and surprise, glancing at the\\nclock more frequently and at the window less hopefully than before.', 'At\\nlength, the clock was hidden from his sight by some envious shutters,\\nthen the church steeples proclaimed eleven at night, then the quarter\\npast, and then the conviction seemed to obtrude itself on his mind that\\nit was no use tarrying there any longer.', 'That the conviction was an unwelcome one, and that he was by no means\\nwilling to yield to it, was apparent from his reluctance to quit the\\nspot; from the tardy steps with which he often left it, still looking\\nover his shoulder at the same window; and from the precipitation with\\nwhich he as often returned, when a fancied noise or the changing and\\nimperfect light induced him to suppose it had been softly raised.', 'At\\nlength, he gave the matter up, as hopeless for that night, and suddenly\\nbreaking into a run as though to force himself away, scampered off at\\nhis utmost speed, nor once ventured to look behind him lest he should\\nbe tempted back again.', 'Without relaxing his pace, or stopping to take breath, this mysterious\\nindividual dashed on through a great many alleys and narrow ways until\\nhe at length arrived in a square paved court, when he subsided into a\\nwalk, and making for a small house from the window of which a light was\\nshining, lifted the latch of the door and passed in.', '‘Bless us!’ cried a woman turning sharply round, ‘who’s that?', 'Oh!', 'It’s you, Kit!’\\n\\n‘Yes, mother, it’s me.’\\n\\n‘Why, how tired you look, my dear!’\\n\\n‘Old master an’t gone out to-night,’ said Kit; ‘and so she hasn’t been\\nat the window at all.’  With which words, he sat down by the fire and\\nlooked very mournful and discontented.', 'The room in which Kit sat himself down, in this condition, was an\\nextremely poor and homely place, but with that air of comfort about it,\\nnevertheless, which--or the spot must be a wretched one\\nindeed--cleanliness and order can always impart in some degree.', 'Late\\nas the Dutch clock showed it to be, the poor woman was still hard at\\nwork at an ironing-table; a young child lay sleeping in a cradle near\\nthe fire; and another, a sturdy boy of two or three years old, very\\nwide awake, with a very tight night-cap on his head, and a night-gown\\nvery much too small for him on his body, was sitting bolt upright in a\\nclothes-basket, staring over the rim with his great round eyes, and\\nlooking as if he had thoroughly made up his mind never to go to sleep\\nany more; which, as he had already declined to take his natural rest\\nand had been brought out of bed in consequence, opened a cheerful\\nprospect for his relations and friends.', 'It was rather a queer-looking\\nfamily: Kit, his mother, and the children, being all strongly alike.', 'Kit was disposed to be out of temper, as the best of us are too\\noften--but he looked at the youngest child who was sleeping soundly,\\nand from him to his other brother in the clothes-basket, and from him\\nto their mother, who had been at work without complaint since morning,\\nand thought it would be a better and kinder thing to be good-humoured.', 'So he rocked the cradle with his foot; made a face at the rebel in the\\nclothes-basket, which put him in high good-humour directly; and stoutly\\ndetermined to be talkative and make himself agreeable.', '‘Ah, mother!’ said Kit, taking out his clasp-knife, and falling upon a\\ngreat piece of bread and meat which she had had ready for him, hours\\nbefore, ‘what a one you are!', 'There an’t many such as you, I know.’\\n\\n‘I hope there are many a great deal better, Kit,’ said Mrs Nubbles;\\n‘and that there are, or ought to be, accordin’ to what the parson at\\nchapel says.’\\n\\n‘Much he knows about it,’ returned Kit contemptuously.', '‘Wait till he’s\\na widder and works like you do, and gets as little, and does as much,\\nand keeps his spirit up the same, and then I’ll ask him what’s o’clock\\nand trust him for being right to half a second.’\\n\\n‘Well,’ said Mrs Nubbles, evading the point, ‘your beer’s down there by\\nthe fender, Kit.’\\n\\n‘I see,’ replied her son, taking up the porter pot, ‘my love to you,\\nmother.', 'And the parson’s health too if you like.', 'I don’t bear him any\\nmalice, not I!’\\n\\n‘Did you tell me, just now, that your master hadn’t gone out to-night?’\\ninquired Mrs Nubbles.', '‘Yes,’ said Kit, ‘worse luck!’\\n\\n‘You should say better luck, I think,’ returned his mother, ‘because\\nMiss Nelly won’t have been left alone.’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ said Kit, ‘I forgot that.', 'I said worse luck, because I’ve been\\nwatching ever since eight o’clock, and seen nothing of her.’\\n\\n‘I wonder what she’d say,’ cried his mother, stopping in her work and\\nlooking round, ‘if she knew that every night, when she--poor thing--is\\nsitting alone at that window, you are watching in the open street for\\nfear any harm should come to her, and that you never leave the place or\\ncome home to your bed though you’re ever so tired, till such time as\\nyou think she’s safe in hers.’\\n\\n‘Never mind what she’d say,’ replied Kit, with something like a blush\\non his uncouth face; ‘she’ll never know nothing, and consequently,\\nshe’ll never say nothing.’\\n\\nMrs Nubbles ironed away in silence for a minute or two, and coming to\\nthe fireplace for another iron, glanced stealthily at Kit while she\\nrubbed it on a board and dusted it with a duster, but said nothing\\nuntil she had returned to her table again: when, holding the iron at an\\nalarmingly short distance from her cheek, to test its temperature, and\\nlooking round with a smile, she observed:\\n\\n‘I know what some people would say, Kit--’\\n\\n‘Nonsense,’ interposed Kit with a perfect apprehension of what was to\\nfollow.', '‘No, but they would indeed.', 'Some people would say that you’d fallen in\\nlove with her, I know they would.’\\n\\nTo this, Kit only replied by bashfully bidding his mother ‘get out,’\\nand forming sundry strange figures with his legs and arms, accompanied\\nby sympathetic contortions of his face.', 'Not deriving from these means\\nthe relief which he sought, he bit off an immense mouthful from the\\nbread and meat, and took a quick drink of the porter; by which\\nartificial aids he choked himself and effected a diversion of the\\nsubject.', '‘Speaking seriously though, Kit,’ said his mother, taking up the theme\\nafresh, after a time, ‘for of course I was only in joke just now, it’s\\nvery good and thoughtful, and like you, to do this, and never let\\nanybody know it, though some day I hope she may come to know it, for\\nI’m sure she would be very grateful to you and feel it very much.', 'It’s\\na cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there.', 'I don’t wonder\\nthat the old gentleman wants to keep it from you.’\\n\\n‘He don’t think it’s cruel, bless you,’ said Kit, ‘and don’t mean it to\\nbe so, or he wouldn’t do it--I do consider, mother, that he wouldn’t do\\nit for all the gold and silver in the world.', 'No, no, that he wouldn’t.', 'I know him better than that.’\\n\\n‘Then what does he do it for, and why does he keep it so close from\\nyou?’ said Mrs Nubbles.', '‘That I don’t know,’ returned her son.', '‘If he hadn’t tried to keep it\\nso close though, I should never have found it out, for it was his\\ngetting me away at night and sending me off so much earlier than he\\nused to, that first made me curious to know what was going on.', 'Hark!', 'what’s that?’\\n\\n‘It’s only somebody outside.’\\n\\n‘It’s somebody crossing over here,’ said Kit, standing up to listen,\\n‘and coming very fast too.', 'He can’t have gone out after I left, and\\nthe house caught fire, mother!’\\n\\nThe boy stood, for a moment, really bereft, by the apprehension he had\\nconjured up, of the power to move.', 'The footsteps drew nearer, the door\\nwas opened with a hasty hand, and the child herself, pale and\\nbreathless, and hastily wrapped in a few disordered garments, hurried\\ninto the room.', '‘Miss Nelly!', 'What is the matter!’ cried mother and son together.', '‘I must not stay a moment,’ she returned, ‘grandfather has been taken\\nvery ill.', 'I found him in a fit upon the floor--’\\n\\n‘I’ll run for a doctor’--said Kit, seizing his brimless hat.', '‘I’ll be\\nthere directly, I’ll--’\\n\\n‘No, no,’ cried Nell, ‘there is one there, you’re not wanted,\\nyou--you--must never come near us any more!’\\n\\n‘What!’ roared Kit.', '‘Never again,’ said the child.', '‘Don’t ask me why, for I don’t know.', 'Pray don’t ask me why, pray don’t be sorry, pray don’t be vexed with\\nme!', 'I have nothing to do with it indeed!’\\n\\nKit looked at her with his eyes stretched wide; and opened and shut his\\nmouth a great many times; but couldn’t get out one word.', '‘He complains and raves of you,’ said the child, ‘I don’t know what you\\nhave done, but I hope it’s nothing very bad.’\\n\\n‘I done!’ roared Kit.', '‘He cried that you’re the cause of all his misery,’ returned the child\\nwith tearful eyes; ‘he screamed and called for you; they say you must\\nnot come near him or he will die.', 'You must not return to us any more.', 'I came to tell you.', 'I thought it would be better that I should come\\nthan somebody quite strange.', 'Oh, Kit, what have you done?', 'You, in\\nwhom I trusted so much, and who were almost the only friend I had!’\\n\\nThe unfortunate Kit looked at his young mistress harder and harder, and\\nwith eyes growing wider and wider, but was perfectly motionless and\\nsilent.', '‘I have brought his money for the week,’ said the child, looking to the\\nwoman and laying it on the table--‘and--and--a little more, for he was\\nalways good and kind to me.', 'I hope he will be sorry and do well\\nsomewhere else and not take this to heart too much.', 'It grieves me very\\nmuch to part with him like this, but there is no help.', 'It must be\\ndone.', 'Good night!’\\n\\nWith the tears streaming down her face, and her slight figure trembling\\nwith the agitation of the scene she had left, the shock she had\\nreceived, the errand she had just discharged, and a thousand painful\\nand affectionate feelings, the child hastened to the door, and\\ndisappeared as rapidly as she had come.', 'The poor woman, who had no cause to doubt her son, but every reason for\\nrelying on his honesty and truth, was staggered, notwithstanding, by\\nhis not having advanced one word in his defence.', 'Visions of gallantry,\\nknavery, robbery; and of the nightly absences from home for which he\\nhad accounted so strangely, having been occasioned by some unlawful\\npursuit; flocked into her brain and rendered her afraid to question\\nhim.', 'She rocked herself upon a chair, wringing her hands and weeping\\nbitterly, but Kit made no attempt to comfort her and remained quite\\nbewildered.', 'The baby in the cradle woke up and cried; the boy in the\\nclothes-basket fell over on his back with the basket upon him, and was\\nseen no more; the mother wept louder yet and rocked faster; but Kit,\\ninsensible to all the din and tumult, remained in a state of utter\\nstupefaction.', 'CHAPTER 11\\n\\nQuiet and solitude were destined to hold uninterrupted rule no longer,\\nbeneath the roof that sheltered the child.', 'Next morning, the old man\\nwas in a raging fever accompanied with delirium; and sinking under the\\ninfluence of this disorder he lay for many weeks in imminent peril of\\nhis life.', 'There was watching enough, now, but it was the watching of\\nstrangers who made a greedy trade of it, and who, in the intervals in\\ntheir attendance upon the sick man huddled together with a ghastly\\ngood-fellowship, and ate and drank and made merry; for disease and\\ndeath were their ordinary household gods.', 'Yet, in all the hurry and crowding of such a time, the child was more\\nalone than she had ever been before; alone in spirit, alone in her\\ndevotion to him who was wasting away upon his burning bed; alone in her\\nunfeigned sorrow, and her unpurchased sympathy.', 'Day after day, and\\nnight after night, found her still by the pillow of the unconscious\\nsufferer, still anticipating his every want, still listening to those\\nrepetitions of her name and those anxieties and cares for her, which\\nwere ever uppermost among his feverish wanderings.', 'The house was no longer theirs.', 'Even the sick chamber seemed to be\\nretained, on the uncertain tenure of Mr Quilp’s favour.', 'The old man’s\\nillness had not lasted many days when he took formal possession of the\\npremises and all upon them, in virtue of certain legal powers to that\\neffect, which few understood and none presumed to call in question.', 'This important step secured, with the assistance of a man of law whom\\nhe brought with him for the purpose, the dwarf proceeded to establish\\nhimself and his coadjutor in the house, as an assertion of his claim\\nagainst all comers; and then set about making his quarters comfortable,\\nafter his own fashion.', 'To this end, Mr Quilp encamped in the back parlour, having first put an\\neffectual stop to any further business by shutting up the shop.', 'Having\\nlooked out, from among the old furniture, the handsomest and most\\ncommodious chair he could possibly find (which he reserved for his own\\nuse) and an especially hideous and uncomfortable one (which he\\nconsiderately appropriated to the accommodation of his friend) he\\ncaused them to be carried into this room, and took up his position in\\ngreat state.', 'The apartment was very far removed from the old man’s\\nchamber, but Mr Quilp deemed it prudent, as a precaution against\\ninfection from fever, and a means of wholesome fumigation, not only to\\nsmoke, himself, without cessation, but to insist upon it that his legal\\nfriend did the like.', 'Moreover, he sent an express to the wharf for the\\ntumbling boy, who arriving with all despatch was enjoined to sit\\nhimself down in another chair just inside the door, continually to\\nsmoke a great pipe which the dwarf had provided for the purpose, and to\\ntake it from his lips under any pretence whatever, were it only for one\\nminute at a time, if he dared.', 'These arrangements completed, Mr Quilp\\nlooked round him with chuckling satisfaction, and remarked that he\\ncalled that comfort.', 'The legal gentleman, whose melodious name was Brass, might have called\\nit comfort also but for two drawbacks: one was, that he could by no\\nexertion sit easy in his chair, the seat of which was very hard,\\nangular, slippery, and sloping; the other, that tobacco-smoke always\\ncaused him great internal discomposure and annoyance.', 'But as he was\\nquite a creature of Mr Quilp’s and had a thousand reasons for\\nconciliating his good opinion, he tried to smile, and nodded his\\nacquiescence with the best grace he could assume.', 'This Brass was an attorney of no very good repute, from Bevis Marks in\\nthe city of London; he was a tall, meagre man, with a nose like a wen,\\na protruding forehead, retreating eyes, and hair of a deep red.', 'He\\nwore a long black surtout reaching nearly to his ankles, short black\\ntrousers, high shoes, and cotton stockings of a bluish grey.', 'He had a\\ncringing manner, but a very harsh voice; and his blandest smiles were\\nso extremely forbidding, that to have had his company under the least\\nrepulsive circumstances, one would have wished him to be out of temper\\nthat he might only scowl.', 'Quilp looked at his legal adviser, and seeing that he was winking very\\nmuch in the anguish of his pipe, that he sometimes shuddered when he\\nhappened to inhale its full flavour, and that he constantly fanned the\\nsmoke from him, was quite overjoyed and rubbed his hands with glee.', '‘Smoke away, you dog,’ said Quilp, turning to the boy; ‘fill your pipe\\nagain and smoke it fast, down to the last whiff, or I’ll put the\\nsealing-waxed end of it in the fire and rub it red hot upon your\\ntongue.’\\n\\nLuckily the boy was case-hardened, and would have smoked a small\\nlime-kiln if anybody had treated him with it.', 'Wherefore, he only\\nmuttered a brief defiance of his master, and did as he was ordered.', '‘Is it good, Brass, is it nice, is it fragrant, do you feel like the\\nGrand Turk?’ said Quilp.', 'Mr Brass thought that if he did, the Grand Turk’s feelings were by no\\nmeans to be envied, but he said it was famous, and he had no doubt he\\nfelt very like that Potentate.', '‘This is the way to keep off fever,’ said Quilp, ‘this is the way to\\nkeep off every calamity of life!', 'We’ll never leave off, all the time\\nwe stop here--smoke away, you dog, or you shall swallow the pipe!’\\n\\n‘Shall we stop here long, Mr Quilp?’ inquired his legal friend, when\\nthe dwarf had given his boy this gentle admonition.', '‘We must stop, I suppose, till the old gentleman up stairs is dead,’\\nreturned Quilp.', '‘He he he!’ laughed Mr Brass, ‘oh!', 'very good!’\\n\\n‘Smoke away!’ cried Quilp.', '‘Never stop!', 'You can talk as you smoke.', 'Don’t lose time.’\\n\\n‘He he he!’ cried Brass faintly, as he again applied himself to the\\nodious pipe.', '‘But if he should get better, Mr Quilp?’\\n\\n‘Then we shall stop till he does, and no longer,’ returned the dwarf.', '‘How kind it is of you, Sir, to wait till then!’ said Brass.', '‘Some\\npeople, Sir, would have sold or removed the goods--oh dear, the very\\ninstant the law allowed ‘em.', 'Some people, Sir, would have been all\\nflintiness and granite.', 'Some people, sir, would have--’\\n\\n‘Some people would have spared themselves the jabbering of such a\\nparrot as you,’ interposed the dwarf.', '‘He he he!’ cried Brass.', '‘You have such spirits!’\\n\\nThe smoking sentinel at the door interposed in this place, and without\\ntaking his pipe from his lips, growled,\\n\\n‘Here’s the gal a comin’ down.’\\n\\n‘The what, you dog?’ said Quilp.', '‘The gal,’ returned the boy.', '‘Are you deaf?’\\n\\n‘Oh!’ said Quilp, drawing in his breath with great relish as if he were\\ntaking soup, ‘you and I will have such a settling presently; there’s\\nsuch a scratching and bruising in store for you, my dear young friend!', 'Aha!', 'Nelly!', 'How is he now, my duck of diamonds?’\\n\\n‘He’s very bad,’ replied the weeping child.', '‘What a pretty little Nell!’ cried Quilp.', '‘Oh beautiful, sir, beautiful indeed,’ said Brass.', '‘Quite charming.’\\n\\n‘Has she come to sit upon Quilp’s knee,’ said the dwarf, in what he\\nmeant to be a soothing tone, ‘or is she going to bed in her own little\\nroom inside here?', 'Which is poor Nelly going to do?’\\n\\n‘What a remarkable pleasant way he has with children!’ muttered Brass,\\nas if in confidence between himself and the ceiling; ‘upon my word it’s\\nquite a treat to hear him.’\\n\\n‘I’m not going to stay at all,’ faltered Nell.', '‘I want a few things\\nout of that room, and then I--I--won’t come down here any more.’\\n\\n‘And a very nice little room it is!’ said the dwarf looking into it as\\nthe child entered.', '‘Quite a bower!', 'You’re sure you’re not going to\\nuse it; you’re sure you’re not coming back, Nelly?’\\n\\n‘No,’ replied the child, hurrying away, with the few articles of dress\\nshe had come to remove; ‘never again!', 'Never again.’\\n\\n‘She’s very sensitive,’ said Quilp, looking after her.', '‘Very\\nsensitive; that’s a pity.', 'The bedstead is much about my size.', 'I think\\nI shall make it MY little room.’\\n\\nMr Brass encouraging this idea, as he would have encouraged any other\\nemanating from the same source, the dwarf walked in to try the effect.', 'This he did, by throwing himself on his back upon the bed with his pipe\\nin his mouth, and then kicking up his legs and smoking violently.', 'Mr\\nBrass applauding this picture very much, and the bed being soft and\\ncomfortable, Mr Quilp determined to use it, both as a sleeping place by\\nnight and as a kind of Divan by day; and in order that it might be\\nconverted to the latter purpose at once, remained where he was, and\\nsmoked his pipe out.', 'The legal gentleman being by this time rather\\ngiddy and perplexed in his ideas (for this was one of the operations of\\nthe tobacco on his nervous system), took the opportunity of slinking\\naway into the open air, where, in course of time, he recovered\\nsufficiently to return with a countenance of tolerable composure.', 'He\\nwas soon led on by the malicious dwarf to smoke himself into a relapse,\\nand in that state stumbled upon a settee where he slept till morning.', 'Such were Mr Quilp’s first proceedings on entering upon his new\\nproperty.', 'He was, for some days, restrained by business from\\nperforming any particular pranks, as his time was pretty well occupied\\nbetween taking, with the assistance of Mr Brass, a minute inventory of\\nall the goods in the place, and going abroad upon his other concerns\\nwhich happily engaged him for several hours at a time.', 'His avarice and\\ncaution being, now, thoroughly awakened, however, he was never absent\\nfrom the house one night; and his eagerness for some termination, good\\nor bad, to the old man’s disorder, increasing rapidly, as the time\\npassed by, soon began to vent itself in open murmurs and exclamations\\nof impatience.', 'Nell shrank timidly from all the dwarf’s advances towards conversation,\\nand fled from the very sound of his voice; nor were the lawyer’s smiles\\nless terrible to her than Quilp’s grimaces.', 'She lived in such\\ncontinual dread and apprehension of meeting one or other of them on the\\nstairs or in the passages if she stirred from her grandfather’s\\nchamber, that she seldom left it, for a moment, until late at night,\\nwhen the silence encouraged her to venture forth and breathe the purer\\nair of some empty room.', 'One night, she had stolen to her usual window, and was sitting there\\nvery sorrowfully--for the old man had been worse that day--when she\\nthought she heard her name pronounced by a voice in the street.', 'Looking down, she recognised Kit, whose endeavours to attract her\\nattention had roused her from her sad reflections.', '‘Miss Nell!’ said the boy in a low voice.', '‘Yes,’ replied the child, doubtful whether she ought to hold any\\ncommunication with the supposed culprit, but inclining to her old\\nfavourite still; ‘what do you want?’\\n\\n‘I have wanted to say a word to you, for a long time,’ the boy replied,\\n‘but the people below have driven me away and wouldn’t let me see you.', 'You don’t believe--I hope you don’t really believe--that I deserve to\\nbe cast off as I have been; do you, miss?’\\n\\n‘I must believe it,’ returned the child.', '‘Or why would grandfather\\nhave been so angry with you?’\\n\\n‘I don’t know,’ replied Kit.', '‘I’m sure I never deserved it from him,\\nno, nor from you.', 'I can say that, with a true and honest heart, any\\nway.', 'And then to be driven from the door, when I only came to ask how\\nold master was--!’\\n\\n‘They never told me that,’ said the child.', '‘I didn’t know it indeed.', 'I wouldn’t have had them do it for the world.’\\n\\n‘Thank’ee, miss,’ returned Kit, ‘it’s comfortable to hear you say that.', 'I said I never would believe that it was your doing.’\\n\\n‘That was right!’ said the child eagerly.', '‘Miss Nell,’ cried the boy coming under the window, and speaking in a\\nlower tone, ‘there are new masters down stairs.', 'It’s a change for you.’\\n\\n‘It is indeed,’ replied the child.', '‘And so it will be for him when he gets better,’ said the boy, pointing\\ntowards the sick room.', '‘--If he ever does,’ added the child, unable to restrain her tears.', '‘Oh, he’ll do that, he’ll do that,’ said Kit.', '‘I’m sure he will.', 'You\\nmustn’t be cast down, Miss Nell.', 'Now don’t be, pray!’\\n\\nThese words of encouragement and consolation were few and roughly said,\\nbut they affected the child and made her, for the moment, weep the more.', '‘He’ll be sure to get better now,’ said the boy anxiously, ‘if you\\ndon’t give way to low spirits and turn ill yourself, which would make\\nhim worse and throw him back, just as he was recovering.', 'When he does,\\nsay a good word--say a kind word for me, Miss Nell!’\\n\\n‘They tell me I must not even mention your name to him for a long, long\\ntime,’ rejoined the child, ‘I dare not; and even if I might, what good\\nwould a kind word do you, Kit?', 'We shall be very poor.', 'We shall\\nscarcely have bread to eat.’\\n\\n‘It’s not that I may be taken back,’ said the boy, ‘that I ask the\\nfavour of you.', 'It isn’t for the sake of food and wages that I’ve been\\nwaiting about so long in hopes to see you.', 'Don’t think that I’d come\\nin a time of trouble to talk of such things as them.’\\n\\nThe child looked gratefully and kindly at him, but waited that he might\\nspeak again.', '‘No, it’s not that,’ said Kit hesitating, ‘it’s something very\\ndifferent from that.', 'I haven’t got much sense, I know, but if he could\\nbe brought to believe that I’d been a faithful servant to him, doing\\nthe best I could, and never meaning harm, perhaps he mightn’t--’\\n\\nHere Kit faltered so long that the child entreated him to speak out,\\nand quickly, for it was very late, and time to shut the window.', '‘Perhaps he mightn’t think it over venturesome of me to say--well then,\\nto say this,’ cried Kit with sudden boldness.', '‘This home is gone from\\nyou and him.', 'Mother and I have got a poor one, but that’s better than\\nthis with all these people here; and why not come there, till he’s had\\ntime to look about, and find a better!’\\n\\nThe child did not speak.', 'Kit, in the relief of having made his\\nproposition, found his tongue loosened, and spoke out in its favour\\nwith his utmost eloquence.', '‘You think,’ said the boy, ‘that it’s very small and inconvenient.', 'So\\nit is, but it’s very clean.', 'Perhaps you think it would be noisy, but\\nthere’s not a quieter court than ours in all the town.', 'Don’t be afraid\\nof the children; the baby hardly ever cries, and the other one is very\\ngood--besides, I’d mind ‘em.', 'They wouldn’t vex you much, I’m sure.', 'Do\\ntry, Miss Nell, do try.', 'The little front room up stairs is very\\npleasant.', 'You can see a piece of the church-clock, through the\\nchimneys, and almost tell the time; mother says it would be just the\\nthing for you, and so it would, and you’d have her to wait upon you\\nboth, and me to run of errands.', 'We don’t mean money, bless you; you’re\\nnot to think of that!', 'Will you try him, Miss Nell?', 'Only say you’ll\\ntry him.', 'Do try to make old master come, and ask him first what I have\\ndone.', 'Will you only promise that, Miss Nell?’\\n\\nBefore the child could reply to this earnest solicitation, the\\nstreet-door opened, and Mr Brass thrusting out his night-capped head\\ncalled in a surly voice, ‘Who’s there!’  Kit immediately glided away,\\nand Nell, closing the window softly, drew back into the room.', 'Before Mr Brass had repeated his inquiry many times, Mr Quilp, also\\nembellished with a night-cap, emerged from the same door and looked\\ncarefully up and down the street, and up at all the windows of the\\nhouse, from the opposite side.', 'Finding that there was nobody in sight,\\nhe presently returned into the house with his legal friend, protesting\\n(as the child heard from the staircase), that there was a league and\\nplot against him; that he was in danger of being robbed and plundered\\nby a band of conspirators who prowled about the house at all seasons;\\nand that he would delay no longer but take immediate steps for\\ndisposing of the property and returning to his own peaceful roof.', 'Having growled forth these, and a great many other threats of the same\\nnature, he coiled himself once more in the child’s little bed, and Nell\\ncrept softly up the stairs.', 'It was natural enough that her short and unfinished dialogue with Kit\\nshould leave a strong impression on her mind, and influence her dreams\\nthat night and her recollections for a long, long time.', 'Surrounded by\\nunfeeling creditors, and mercenary attendants upon the sick, and\\nmeeting in the height of her anxiety and sorrow with little regard or\\nsympathy even from the women about her, it is not surprising that the\\naffectionate heart of the child should have been touched to the quick\\nby one kind and generous spirit, however uncouth the temple in which it\\ndwelt.', 'Thank Heaven that the temples of such spirits are not made with\\nhands, and that they may be even more worthily hung with poor\\npatch-work than with purple and fine linen!', 'CHAPTER 12\\n\\nAt length, the crisis of the old man’s disorder was past, and he began\\nto mend.', 'By very slow and feeble degrees his consciousness came back;\\nbut the mind was weakened and its functions were impaired.', 'He was\\npatient, and quiet; often sat brooding, but not despondently, for a\\nlong space; was easily amused, even by a sun-beam on the wall or\\nceiling; made no complaint that the days were long, or the nights\\ntedious; and appeared indeed to have lost all count of time, and every\\nsense of care or weariness.', 'He would sit, for hours together, with\\nNell’s small hand in his, playing with the fingers and stopping\\nsometimes to smooth her hair or kiss her brow; and, when he saw that\\ntears were glistening in her eyes, would look, amazed, about him for\\nthe cause, and forget his wonder even while he looked.', 'The child and he rode out; the old man propped up with pillows, and the\\nchild beside him.', 'They were hand in hand as usual.', 'The noise and\\nmotion in the streets fatigued his brain at first, but he was not\\nsurprised, or curious, or pleased, or irritated.', 'He was asked if he\\nremembered this, or that.', '‘O yes,’ he said, ‘quite well--why not?’\\nSometimes he turned his head, and looked, with earnest gaze and\\noutstretched neck, after some stranger in the crowd, until he\\ndisappeared from sight; but, to the question why he did this, he\\nanswered not a word.', 'He was sitting in his easy chair one day, and Nell upon a stool beside\\nhim, when a man outside the door inquired if he might enter.', '‘Yes,’ he\\nsaid without emotion, ‘it was Quilp, he knew.', 'Quilp was master there.', 'Of course he might come in.’  And so he did.', '‘I’m glad to see you well again at last, neighbour,’ said the dwarf,\\nsitting down opposite him.', '‘You’re quite strong now?’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ said the old man feebly, ‘yes.’\\n\\n‘I don’t want to hurry you, you know, neighbour,’ said the dwarf,\\nraising his voice, for the old man’s senses were duller than they had\\nbeen; ‘but, as soon as you can arrange your future proceedings, the\\nbetter.’\\n\\n‘Surely,’ said the old man.', '‘The better for all parties.’\\n\\n‘You see,’ pursued Quilp after a short pause, ‘the goods being once\\nremoved, this house would be uncomfortable; uninhabitable in fact.’\\n\\n‘You say true,’ returned the old man.', '‘Poor Nell too, what would she\\ndo?’\\n\\n‘Exactly,’ bawled the dwarf nodding his head; ‘that’s very well\\nobserved.', 'Then will you consider about it, neighbour?’\\n\\n‘I will, certainly,’ replied the old man.', '‘We shall not stop here.’\\n\\n‘So I supposed,’ said the dwarf.', '‘I have sold the things.', 'They have\\nnot yielded quite as much as they might have done, but pretty\\nwell--pretty well.', 'To-day’s Tuesday.', 'When shall they be moved?', 'There’s no hurry--shall we say this afternoon?’\\n\\n‘Say Friday morning,’ returned the old man.', '‘Very good,’ said the dwarf.', '‘So be it--with the understanding that I\\ncan’t go beyond that day, neighbour, on any account.’\\n\\n‘Good,’ returned the old man.', '‘I shall remember it.’\\n\\nMr Quilp seemed rather puzzled by the strange, even spiritless way in\\nwhich all this was said; but as the old man nodded his head and\\nrepeated ‘on Friday morning.', 'I shall remember it,’ he had no excuse\\nfor dwelling on the subject any further, and so took a friendly leave\\nwith many expressions of good-will and many compliments to his friend\\non his looking so remarkably well; and went below stairs to report\\nprogress to Mr Brass.', 'All that day, and all the next, the old man remained in this state.', 'He\\nwandered up and down the house and into and out of the various rooms,\\nas if with some vague intent of bidding them adieu, but he referred\\nneither by direct allusions nor in any other manner to the interview of\\nthe morning or the necessity of finding some other shelter.', 'An\\nindistinct idea he had, that the child was desolate and in want of\\nhelp; for he often drew her to his bosom and bade her be of good cheer,\\nsaying that they would not desert each other; but he seemed unable to\\ncontemplate their real position more distinctly, and was still the\\nlistless, passionless creature that suffering of mind and body had left\\nhim.', 'We call this a state of childishness, but it is the same poor hollow\\nmockery of it, that death is of sleep.', 'Where, in the dull eyes of\\ndoating men, are the laughing light and life of childhood, the gaiety\\nthat has known no check, the frankness that has felt no chill, the hope\\nthat has never withered, the joys that fade in blossoming?', 'Where, in\\nthe sharp lineaments of rigid and unsightly death, is the calm beauty\\nof slumber, telling of rest for the waking hours that are past, and\\ngentle hopes and loves for those which are to come?', 'Lay death and\\nsleep down, side by side, and say who shall find the two akin.', 'Send\\nforth the child and childish man together, and blush for the pride that\\nlibels our own old happy state, and gives its title to an ugly and\\ndistorted image.', 'Thursday arrived, and there was no alteration in the old man.', 'But a\\nchange came upon him that evening as he and the child sat silently\\ntogether.', 'In a small dull yard below his window, there was a tree--green and\\nflourishing enough, for such a place--and as the air stirred among its\\nleaves, it threw a rippling shadow on the white wall.', 'The old man sat\\nwatching the shadows as they trembled in this patch of light, until the\\nsun went down; and when it was night, and the moon was slowly rising,\\nhe still sat in the same spot.', 'To one who had been tossing on a restless bed so long, even these few\\ngreen leaves and this tranquil light, although it languished among\\nchimneys and house-tops, were pleasant things.', 'They suggested quiet\\nplaces afar off, and rest, and peace.', 'The child thought, more than\\nonce that he was moved: and had forborne to speak.', 'But now he shed\\ntears--tears that it lightened her aching heart to see--and making as\\nthough he would fall upon his knees, besought her to forgive him.', '‘Forgive you--what?’ said Nell, interposing to prevent his purpose.', '‘Oh grandfather, what should I forgive?’\\n\\n‘All that is past, all that has come upon thee, Nell, all that was done\\nin that uneasy dream,’ returned the old man.', '‘Do not talk so,’ said the child.', '‘Pray do not.', 'Let us speak of\\nsomething else.’\\n\\n‘Yes, yes, we will,’ he rejoined.', '‘And it shall be of what we talked\\nof long ago--many months--months is it, or weeks, or days?', 'which is it\\nNell?’\\n\\n‘I do not understand you,’ said the child.', '‘It has come back upon me to-day, it has all come back since we have\\nbeen sitting here.', 'I bless thee for it, Nell!’\\n\\n‘For what, dear grandfather?’\\n\\n‘For what you said when we were first made beggars, Nell.', 'Let us speak\\nsoftly.', 'Hush!', 'for if they knew our purpose down stairs, they would\\ncry that I was mad and take thee from me.', 'We will not stop here\\nanother day.', 'We will go far away from here.’\\n\\n‘Yes, let us go,’ said the child earnestly.', '‘Let us begone from this\\nplace, and never turn back or think of it again.', 'Let us wander\\nbarefoot through the world, rather than linger here.’\\n\\n‘We will,’ answered the old man, ‘we will travel afoot through the\\nfields and woods, and by the side of rivers, and trust ourselves to God\\nin the places where He dwells.', 'It is far better to lie down at night\\nbeneath an open sky like that yonder--see how bright it is--than to\\nrest in close rooms which are always full of care and weary dreams.', 'Thou and I together, Nell, may be cheerful and happy yet, and learn to\\nforget this time, as if it had never been.’\\n\\n‘We will be happy,’ cried the child.', '‘We never can be here.’\\n\\n‘No, we never can again--never again--that’s truly said,’ rejoined the\\nold man.', '‘Let us steal away to-morrow morning--early and softly, that\\nwe may not be seen or heard--and leave no trace or track for them to\\nfollow by.', 'Poor Nell!', 'Thy cheek is pale, and thy eyes are heavy with\\nwatching and weeping for me--I know--for me; but thou wilt be well\\nagain, and merry too, when we are far away.', 'To-morrow morning, dear,\\nwe’ll turn our faces from this scene of sorrow, and be as free and\\nhappy as the birds.’\\n\\nAnd then the old man clasped his hands above her head, and said, in a\\nfew broken words, that from that time forth they would wander up and\\ndown together, and never part more until Death took one or other of the\\ntwain.', 'The child’s heart beat high with hope and confidence.', 'She had no\\nthought of hunger, or cold, or thirst, or suffering.', 'She saw in this,\\nbut a return of the simple pleasures they had once enjoyed, a relief\\nfrom the gloomy solitude in which she had lived, an escape from the\\nheartless people by whom she had been surrounded in her late time of\\ntrial, the restoration of the old man’s health and peace, and a life of\\ntranquil happiness.', 'Sun, and stream, and meadow, and summer days,\\nshone brightly in her view, and there was no dark tint in all the\\nsparkling picture.', 'The old man had slept, for some hours, soundly in his bed, and she was\\nyet busily engaged in preparing for their flight.', 'There were a few\\narticles of clothing for herself to carry, and a few for him; old\\ngarments, such as became their fallen fortunes, laid out to wear; and a\\nstaff to support his feeble steps, put ready for his use.', 'But this was\\nnot all her task; for now she must visit the old rooms for the last\\ntime.', 'And how different the parting with them was, from any she had expected,\\nand most of all from that which she had oftenest pictured to herself.', 'How could she ever have thought of bidding them farewell in triumph,\\nwhen the recollection of the many hours she had passed among them rose\\nto her swelling heart, and made her feel the wish a cruelty: lonely and\\nsad though many of those hours had been!', 'She sat down at the window\\nwhere she had spent so many evenings--darker far than this--and every\\nthought of hope or cheerfulness that had occurred to her in that place\\ncame vividly upon her mind, and blotted out all its dull and mournful\\nassociations in an instant.', 'Her own little room too, where she had so often knelt down and prayed\\nat night--prayed for the time which she hoped was dawning now--the\\nlittle room where she had slept so peacefully, and dreamed such\\npleasant dreams!', 'It was hard not to be able to glance round it once\\nmore, and to be forced to leave it without one kind look or grateful\\ntear.', 'There were some trifles there--poor useless things--that she\\nwould have liked to take away; but that was impossible.', 'This brought to mind her bird, her poor bird, who hung there yet.', 'She\\nwept bitterly for the loss of this little creature--until the idea\\noccurred to her--she did not know how, or why, it came into her\\nhead--that it might, by some means, fall into the hands of Kit who\\nwould keep it for her sake, and think, perhaps, that she had left it\\nbehind in the hope that he might have it, and as an assurance that she\\nwas grateful to him.', 'She was calmed and comforted by the thought, and\\nwent to rest with a lighter heart.', 'From many dreams of rambling through light and sunny places, but with\\nsome vague object unattained which ran indistinctly through them all,\\nshe awoke to find that it was yet night, and that the stars were\\nshining brightly in the sky.', 'At length, the day began to glimmer, and\\nthe stars to grow pale and dim.', 'As soon as she was sure of this, she\\narose, and dressed herself for the journey.', 'The old man was yet asleep, and as she was unwilling to disturb him,\\nshe left him to slumber on, until the sun rose.', 'He was anxious that\\nthey should leave the house without a minute’s loss of time, and was\\nsoon ready.', 'The child then took him by the hand, and they trod lightly and\\ncautiously down the stairs, trembling whenever a board creaked, and\\noften stopping to listen.', 'The old man had forgotten a kind of wallet\\nwhich contained the light burden he had to carry; and the going back a\\nfew steps to fetch it seemed an interminable delay.', 'At last they reached the passage on the ground floor, where the snoring\\nof Mr Quilp and his legal friend sounded more terrible in their ears\\nthan the roars of lions.', 'The bolts of the door were rusty, and\\ndifficult to unfasten without noise.', 'When they were all drawn back, it\\nwas found to be locked, and worst of all, the key was gone.', 'Then the\\nchild remembered, for the first time, one of the nurses having told her\\nthat Quilp always locked both the house-doors at night, and kept the\\nkeys on the table in his bedroom.', 'It was not without great fear and trepidation that little Nell slipped\\noff her shoes and gliding through the store-room of old curiosities,\\nwhere Mr Brass--the ugliest piece of goods in all the stock--lay\\nsleeping on a mattress, passed into her own little chamber.', 'Here she stood, for a few moments, quite transfixed with terror at the\\nsight of Mr Quilp, who was hanging so far out of bed that he almost\\nseemed to be standing on his head, and who, either from the uneasiness\\nof this posture, or in one of his agreeable habits, was gasping and\\ngrowling with his mouth wide open, and the whites (or rather the dirty\\nyellows) of his eyes distinctly visible.', 'It was no time, however, to\\nask whether anything ailed him; so, possessing herself of the key after\\none hasty glance about the room, and repassing the prostrate Mr Brass,\\nshe rejoined the old man in safety.', 'They got the door open without\\nnoise, and passing into the street, stood still.', '‘Which way?’ said the child.', 'The old man looked, irresolutely and helplessly, first at her, then to\\nthe right and left, then at her again, and shook his head.', 'It was\\nplain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader.', 'The child felt\\nit, but had no doubts or misgiving, and putting her hand in his, led\\nhim gently away.', 'It was the beginning of a day in June; the deep blue sky unsullied by a\\ncloud, and teeming with brilliant light.', 'The streets were, as yet,\\nnearly free from passengers, the houses and shops were closed, and the\\nhealthy air of morning fell like breath from angels, on the sleeping\\ntown.', 'The old man and the child passed on through the glad silence, elate\\nwith hope and pleasure.', 'They were alone together, once again; every\\nobject was bright and fresh; nothing reminded them, otherwise than by\\ncontrast, of the monotony and constraint they had left behind; church\\ntowers and steeples, frowning and dark at other times, now shone in the\\nsun; each humble nook and corner rejoiced in light; and the sky, dimmed\\nonly by excessive distance, shed its placid smile on everything beneath.', 'Forth from the city, while it yet slumbered, went the two poor\\nadventurers, wandering they knew not whither.', 'CHAPTER 13\\n\\nDaniel Quilp of Tower Hill, and Sampson Brass of Bevis Marks in the\\ncity of London, Gentleman, one of her Majesty’s attornies of the Courts\\nof the King’s Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster and a solicitor of\\nthe High Court of Chancery, slumbered on, unconscious and unsuspicious\\nof any mischance, until a knocking on the street door, often repeated\\nand gradually mounting up from a modest single rap to a perfect battery\\nof knocks, fired in long discharges with a very short interval between,\\ncaused the said Daniel Quilp to struggle into a horizontal position,\\nand to stare at the ceiling with a drowsy indifference, betokening that\\nhe heard the noise and rather wondered at the same, and couldn’t be at\\nthe trouble of bestowing any further thought upon the subject.', 'As the knocking, however, instead of accommodating itself to his lazy\\nstate, increased in vigour and became more importunate, as if in\\nearnest remonstrance against his falling asleep again, now that he had\\nonce opened his eyes, Daniel Quilp began by degrees to comprehend the\\npossibility of there being somebody at the door; and thus he gradually\\ncame to recollect that it was Friday morning, and he had ordered Mrs\\nQuilp to be in waiting upon him at an early hour.', 'Mr Brass, after writhing about, in a great many strange attitudes, and\\noften twisting his face and eyes into an expression like that which is\\nusually produced by eating gooseberries very early in the season, was\\nby this time awake also.', 'Seeing that Mr Quilp invested himself in his\\nevery-day garments, he hastened to do the like, putting on his shoes\\nbefore his stockings, and thrusting his legs into his coat sleeves, and\\nmaking such other small mistakes in his toilet as are not uncommon to\\nthose who dress in a hurry, and labour under the agitation of having\\nbeen suddenly roused.', 'While the attorney was thus engaged, the dwarf was groping under the\\ntable, muttering desperate imprecations on himself, and mankind in\\ngeneral, and all inanimate objects to boot, which suggested to Mr Brass\\nthe question, ‘what’s the matter?’\\n\\n‘The key,’ said the dwarf, looking viciously about him, ‘the\\ndoor-key--that’s the matter.', 'D’ye know anything of it?’\\n\\n‘How should I know anything of it, sir?’ returned Mr Brass.', '‘How should you?’ repeated Quilp with a sneer.', '‘You’re a nice lawyer,\\nan’t you?', 'Ugh, you idiot!’\\n\\nNot caring to represent to the dwarf in his present humour, that the\\nloss of a key by another person could scarcely be said to affect his\\n(Brass’s) legal knowledge in any material degree, Mr Brass humbly\\nsuggested that it must have been forgotten over night, and was,\\ndoubtless, at that moment in its native key-hole.', 'Notwithstanding that\\nMr Quilp had a strong conviction to the contrary, founded on his\\nrecollection of having carefully taken it out, he was fain to admit\\nthat this was possible, and therefore went grumbling to the door where,\\nsure enough, he found it.', 'Now, just as Mr Quilp laid his hand upon the lock, and saw with great\\nastonishment that the fastenings were undone, the knocking came again\\nwith the most irritating violence, and the daylight which had been\\nshining through the key-hole was intercepted on the outside by a human\\neye.', 'The dwarf was very much exasperated, and wanting somebody to\\nwreak his ill-humour upon, determined to dart out suddenly, and favour\\nMrs Quilp with a gentle acknowledgment of her attention in making that\\nhideous uproar.', 'With this view, he drew back the lock very silently and softly, and\\nopening the door all at once, pounced out upon the person on the other\\nside, who had at that moment raised the knocker for another\\napplication, and at whom the dwarf ran head first: throwing out his\\nhands and feet together, and biting the air in the fulness of his\\nmalice.', 'So far, however, from rushing upon somebody who offered no resistance\\nand implored his mercy, Mr Quilp was no sooner in the arms of the\\nindividual whom he had taken for his wife than he found himself\\ncomplimented with two staggering blows on the head, and two more, of\\nthe same quality, in the chest; and closing with his assailant, such a\\nshower of buffets rained down upon his person as sufficed to convince\\nhim that he was in skilful and experienced hands.', 'Nothing daunted by\\nthis reception, he clung tight to his opponent, and bit and hammered\\naway with such good-will and heartiness, that it was at least a couple\\nof minutes before he was dislodged.', 'Then, and not until then, Daniel\\nQuilp found himself, all flushed and dishevelled, in the middle of the\\nstreet, with Mr Richard Swiveller performing a kind of dance round him\\nand requiring to know ‘whether he wanted any more?’\\n\\n‘There’s plenty more of it at the same shop,’ said Mr Swiveller, by\\nturns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude, ‘a large and\\nextensive assortment always on hand--country orders executed with\\npromptitude and despatch--will you have a little more, Sir--don’t say\\nno, if you’d rather not.’\\n\\n‘I thought it was somebody else,’ said Quilp, rubbing his shoulders,\\n‘why didn’t you say who you were?’\\n\\n‘Why didn’t you say who YOU were?’ returned Dick, ‘instead of flying\\nout of the house like a Bedlamite?’\\n\\n‘It was you that--that knocked,’ said the dwarf, getting up with a\\nshort groan, ‘was it?’\\n\\n‘Yes, I am the man,’ replied Dick.', '‘That lady had begun when I came,\\nbut she knocked too soft, so I relieved her.’  As he said this, he\\npointed towards Mrs Quilp, who stood trembling at a little distance.', '‘Humph!’ muttered the dwarf, darting an angry look at his wife, ‘I\\nthought it was your fault!', 'And you, sir--don’t you know there has been\\nsomebody ill here, that you knock as if you’d beat the door down?’\\n\\n‘Damme!’ answered Dick, ‘that’s why I did it.', 'I thought there was\\nsomebody dead here.’\\n\\n‘You came for some purpose, I suppose,’ said Quilp.', '‘What is it you\\nwant?’\\n\\n‘I want to know how the old gentleman is,’ rejoined Mr Swiveller, ‘and\\nto hear from Nell herself, with whom I should like to have a little\\ntalk.', 'I’m a friend of the family, sir--at least I’m the friend of one\\nof the family, and that’s the same thing.’\\n\\n‘You’d better walk in then,’ said the dwarf.', '‘Go on, sir, go on.', 'Now,\\nMrs Quilp--after you, ma’am.’\\n\\nMrs Quilp hesitated, but Mr Quilp insisted.', 'And it was not a contest\\nof politeness, or by any means a matter of form, for she knew very well\\nthat her husband wished to enter the house in this order, that he might\\nhave a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms,\\nwhich were seldom free from impressions of his fingers in black and\\nblue colours.', 'Mr Swiveller, who was not in the secret, was a little\\nsurprised to hear a suppressed scream, and, looking round, to see Mrs\\nQuilp following him with a sudden jerk; but he did not remark on these\\nappearances, and soon forgot them.', '‘Now, Mrs Quilp,’ said the dwarf when they had entered the shop, ‘go\\nyou up stairs, if you please, to Nelly’s room, and tell her that she’s\\nwanted.’\\n\\n‘You seem to make yourself at home here,’ said Dick, who was\\nunacquainted with Mr Quilp’s authority.', '‘I AM at home, young gentleman,’ returned the dwarf.', 'Dick was pondering what these words might mean, and still more what the\\npresence of Mr Brass might mean, when Mrs Quilp came hurrying down\\nstairs, declaring that the rooms above were empty.', '‘Empty, you fool!’ said the dwarf.', '‘I give you my word, Quilp,’ answered his trembling wife, ‘that I have\\nbeen into every room and there’s not a soul in any of them.’\\n\\n‘And that,’ said Mr Brass, clapping his hands once, with an emphasis,\\n‘explains the mystery of the key!’\\n\\nQuilp looked frowningly at him, and frowningly at his wife, and\\nfrowningly at Richard Swiveller; but, receiving no enlightenment from\\nany of them, hurried up stairs, whence he soon hurried down again,\\nconfirming the report which had already been made.', '‘It’s a strange way of going,’ he said, glancing at Swiveller, ‘very\\nstrange not to communicate with me who am such a close and intimate\\nfriend of his!', 'Ah!', 'he’ll write to me no doubt, or he’ll bid Nelly\\nwrite--yes, yes, that’s what he’ll do.', 'Nelly’s very fond of me.', 'Pretty Nell!’\\n\\nMr Swiveller looked, as he was, all open-mouthed astonishment.', 'Still\\nglancing furtively at him, Quilp turned to Mr Brass and observed, with\\nassumed carelessness, that this need not interfere with the removal of\\nthe goods.', '‘For indeed,’ he added, ‘we knew that they’d go away to-day, but not\\nthat they’d go so early, or so quietly.', 'But they have their reasons,\\nthey have their reasons.’\\n\\n‘Where in the devil’s name are they gone?’ said the wondering Dick.', 'Quilp shook his head, and pursed up his lips, in a manner which implied\\nthat he knew very well, but was not at liberty to say.', '‘And what,’ said Dick, looking at the confusion about him, ‘what do you\\nmean by moving the goods?’\\n\\n‘That I have bought ‘em, Sir,’ rejoined Quilp.', '‘Eh?', 'What then?’\\n\\n‘Has the sly old fox made his fortune then, and gone to live in a\\ntranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing\\nsea?’ said Dick, in great bewilderment.', '‘Keeping his place of retirement very close, that he may not be visited\\ntoo often by affectionate grandsons and their devoted friends, eh?’\\nadded the dwarf, rubbing his hands hard; ‘I say nothing, but is that\\nyour meaning?’\\n\\nRichard Swiveller was utterly aghast at this unexpected alteration of\\ncircumstances, which threatened the complete overthrow of the project\\nin which he bore so conspicuous a part, and seemed to nip his prospects\\nin the bud.', 'Having only received from Frederick Trent, late on the\\nprevious night, information of the old man’s illness, he had come upon\\na visit of condolence and inquiry to Nell, prepared with the first\\ninstalment of that long train of fascinations which was to fire her\\nheart at last.', 'And here, when he had been thinking of all kinds of\\ngraceful and insinuating approaches, and meditating on the fearful\\nretaliation which was slowly working against Sophy Wackles--here were\\nNell, the old man, and all the money gone, melted away, decamped he\\nknew not whither, as if with a fore-knowledge of the scheme and a\\nresolution to defeat it in the very outset, before a step was taken.', 'In his secret heart, Daniel Quilp was both surprised and troubled by\\nthe flight which had been made.', 'It had not escaped his keen eye that\\nsome indispensable articles of clothing were gone with the fugitives,\\nand knowing the old man’s weak state of mind, he marvelled what that\\ncourse of proceeding might be in which he had so readily procured the\\nconcurrence of the child.', 'It must not be supposed (or it would be a\\ngross injustice to Mr Quilp) that he was tortured by any disinterested\\nanxiety on behalf of either.', 'His uneasiness arose from a misgiving\\nthat the old man had some secret store of money which he had not\\nsuspected; and the idea of its escaping his clutches, overwhelmed him\\nwith mortification and self-reproach.', 'In this frame of mind, it was some consolation to him to find that\\nRichard Swiveller was, for different reasons, evidently irritated and\\ndisappointed by the same cause.', 'It was plain, thought the dwarf, that\\nhe had come there, on behalf of his friend, to cajole or frighten the\\nold man out of some small fraction of that wealth of which they\\nsupposed him to have an abundance.', 'Therefore, it was a relief to vex\\nhis heart with a picture of the riches the old man hoarded, and to\\nexpatiate on his cunning in removing himself even beyond the reach of\\nimportunity.', '‘Well,’ said Dick, with a blank look, ‘I suppose it’s of no use my\\nstaying here.’\\n\\n‘Not the least in the world,’ rejoined the dwarf.', '‘You’ll mention that I called, perhaps?’ said Dick.', 'Mr Quilp nodded, and said he certainly would, the very first time he\\nsaw them.', '‘And say,’ added Mr Swiveller, ‘say, sir, that I was wafted here upon\\nthe pinions of concord; that I came to remove, with the rake of\\nfriendship, the seeds of mutual violence and heart-burning, and to sow\\nin their place, the germs of social harmony.', 'Will you have the\\ngoodness to charge yourself with that commission, Sir?’\\n\\n‘Certainly!’ rejoined Quilp.', '‘Will you be kind enough to add to it, Sir,’ said Dick, producing a\\nvery small limp card, ‘that that is my address, and that I am to be\\nfound at home every morning.', 'Two distinct knocks, sir, will produce\\nthe slavey at any time.', 'My particular friends, Sir, are accustomed to\\nsneeze when the door is opened, to give her to understand that they ARE\\nmy friends and have no interested motives in asking if I’m at home.', 'I\\nbeg your pardon; will you allow me to look at that card again?’\\n\\n‘Oh!', 'by all means,’ rejoined Quilp.', '‘By a slight and not unnatural mistake, sir,’ said Dick, substituting\\nanother in its stead, ‘I had handed you the pass-ticket of a select\\nconvivial circle called the Glorious Apollers of which I have the\\nhonour to be Perpetual Grand.', 'That is the proper document, Sir.', 'Good\\nmorning.’\\n\\nQuilp bade him good day; the perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious\\nApollers, elevating his hat in honour of Mrs Quilp, dropped it\\ncarelessly on the side of his head again, and disappeared with a\\nflourish.', 'By this time, certain vans had arrived for the conveyance of the goods,\\nand divers strong men in caps were balancing chests of drawers and\\nother trifles of that nature upon their heads, and performing muscular\\nfeats which heightened their complexions considerably.', 'Not to be\\nbehind-hand in the bustle, Mr Quilp went to work with surprising\\nvigour; hustling and driving the people about, like an evil spirit;\\nsetting Mrs Quilp upon all kinds of arduous and impracticable tasks;\\ncarrying great weights up and down, with no apparent effort; kicking\\nthe boy from the wharf, whenever he could get near him; and inflicting,\\nwith his loads, a great many sly bumps and blows on the shoulders of Mr\\nBrass, as he stood upon the door-steps to answer all the inquiries of\\ncurious neighbours, which was his department.', 'His presence and example\\ndiffused such alacrity among the persons employed, that, in a few\\nhours, the house was emptied of everything, but pieces of matting,\\nempty porter-pots, and scattered fragments of straw.', 'Seated, like an African chief, on one of these pieces of matting, the\\ndwarf was regaling himself in the parlour, with bread and cheese and\\nbeer, when he observed without appearing to do so, that a boy was\\nprying in at the outer door.', 'Assured that it was Kit, though he saw\\nlittle more than his nose, Mr Quilp hailed him by his name; whereupon\\nKit came in and demanded what he wanted.', '‘Come here, you sir,’ said the dwarf.', '‘Well, so your old master and\\nyoung mistress have gone?’\\n\\n‘Where?’ rejoined Kit, looking round.', '‘Do you mean to say you don’t know where?’ answered Quilp sharply.', '‘Where have they gone, eh?’\\n\\n‘I don’t know,’ said Kit.', '‘Come,’ retorted Quilp, ‘let’s have no more of this!', 'Do you mean to\\nsay that you don’t know they went away by stealth, as soon as it was\\nlight this morning?’\\n\\n‘No,’ said the boy, in evident surprise.', '‘You don’t know that?’ cried Quilp.', '‘Don’t I know that you were\\nhanging about the house the other night, like a thief, eh?', 'Weren’t you\\ntold then?’\\n\\n‘No,’ replied the boy.', '‘You were not?’ said Quilp.', '‘What were you told then; what were you\\ntalking about?’\\n\\nKit, who knew no particular reason why he should keep the matter secret\\nnow, related the purpose for which he had come on that occasion, and\\nthe proposal he had made.', '‘Oh!’ said the dwarf after a little consideration.', '‘Then, I think\\nthey’ll come to you yet.’\\n\\n‘Do you think they will?’ cried Kit eagerly.', '‘Aye, I think they will,’ returned the dwarf.', '‘Now, when they do, let\\nme know; d’ye hear?', 'Let me know, and I’ll give you something.', 'I want\\nto do ‘em a kindness, and I can’t do ‘em a kindness unless I know where\\nthey are.', 'You hear what I say?’\\n\\nKit might have returned some answer which would not have been agreeable\\nto his irascible questioner, if the boy from the wharf, who had been\\nskulking about the room in search of anything that might have been left\\nabout by accident, had not happened to cry, ‘Here’s a bird!', 'What’s to\\nbe done with this?’\\n\\n‘Wring its neck,’ rejoined Quilp.', '‘Oh no, don’t do that,’ said Kit, stepping forward.', '‘Give it to me.’\\n\\n‘Oh yes, I dare say,’ cried the other boy.', '‘Come!', 'You let the cage\\nalone, and let me wring its neck will you?', 'He said I was to do it.', 'You let the cage alone will you.’\\n\\n‘Give it here, give it to me, you dogs,’ roared Quilp.', '‘Fight for it,\\nyou dogs, or I’ll wring its neck myself!’\\n\\nWithout further persuasion, the two boys fell upon each other, tooth\\nand nail, while Quilp, holding up the cage in one hand, and chopping\\nthe ground with his knife in an ecstasy, urged them on by his taunts\\nand cries to fight more fiercely.', 'They were a pretty equal match, and\\nrolled about together, exchanging blows which were by no means child’s\\nplay, until at length Kit, planting a well-directed hit in his\\nadversary’s chest, disengaged himself, sprung nimbly up, and snatching\\nthe cage from Quilp’s hands made off with his prize.', 'He did not stop once until he reached home, where his bleeding face\\noccasioned great consternation, and caused the elder child to howl\\ndreadfully.', '‘Goodness gracious, Kit, what is the matter, what have you been doing?’\\ncried Mrs Nubbles.', '‘Never you mind, mother,’ answered her son, wiping his face on the\\njack-towel behind the door.', '‘I’m not hurt, don’t you be afraid for me.', 'I’ve been a fightin’ for a bird and won him, that’s all.', 'Hold your\\nnoise, little Jacob.', 'I never see such a naughty boy in all my days!’\\n\\n‘You have been fighting for a bird!’ exclaimed his mother.', '‘Ah!', 'Fightin’ for a bird!’ replied Kit, ‘and here he is--Miss Nelly’s\\nbird, mother, that they was agoin’ to wring the neck of!', 'I stopped\\nthat though--ha ha ha!', 'They wouldn’t wring his neck and me by, no, no.', 'It wouldn’t do, mother, it wouldn’t do at all.', 'Ha ha ha!’\\n\\nKit laughing so heartily, with his swoln and bruised face looking out\\nof the towel, made little Jacob laugh, and then his mother laughed, and\\nthen the baby crowed and kicked with great glee, and then they all\\nlaughed in concert: partly because of Kit’s triumph, and partly because\\nthey were very fond of each other.', 'When this fit was over, Kit\\nexhibited the bird to both children, as a great and precious rarity--it\\nwas only a poor linnet--and looking about the wall for an old nail,\\nmade a scaffolding of a chair and table and twisted it out with great\\nexultation.', '‘Let me see,’ said the boy, ‘I think I’ll hang him in the winder,\\nbecause it’s more light and cheerful, and he can see the sky there, if\\nhe looks up very much.', 'He’s such a one to sing, I can tell you!’\\n\\nSo, the scaffolding was made again, and Kit, climbing up with the poker\\nfor a hammer, knocked in the nail and hung up the cage, to the\\nimmeasurable delight of the whole family.', 'When it had been adjusted\\nand straightened a great many times, and he had walked backwards into\\nthe fire-place in his admiration of it, the arrangement was pronounced\\nto be perfect.', '‘And now, mother,’ said the boy, ‘before I rest any more, I’ll go out\\nand see if I can find a horse to hold, and then I can buy some\\nbirdseed, and a bit of something nice for you, into the bargain.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nAs it was very easy for Kit to persuade himself that the old house was\\nin his way, his way being anywhere, he tried to look upon his passing\\nit once more as a matter of imperative and disagreeable necessity,\\nquite apart from any desire of his own, to which he could not choose\\nbut yield.', 'It is not uncommon for people who are much better fed and\\ntaught than Christopher Nubbles had ever been, to make duties of their\\ninclinations in matters of more doubtful propriety, and to take great\\ncredit for the self-denial with which they gratify themselves.', 'There was no need of any caution this time, and no fear of being\\ndetained by having to play out a return match with Daniel Quilp’s boy.', 'The place was entirely deserted, and looked as dusty and dingy as if it\\nhad been so for months.', 'A rusty padlock was fastened on the door, ends\\nof discoloured blinds and curtains flapped drearily against the\\nhalf-opened upper windows, and the crooked holes cut in the closed\\nshutters below, were black with the darkness of the inside.', 'Some of\\nthe glass in the window he had so often watched, had been broken in the\\nrough hurry of the morning, and that room looked more deserted and dull\\nthan any.', 'A group of idle urchins had taken possession of the\\ndoor-steps; some were plying the knocker and listening with delighted\\ndread to the hollow sounds it spread through the dismantled house;\\nothers were clustered about the keyhole, watching half in jest and half\\nin earnest for ‘the ghost,’ which an hour’s gloom, added to the mystery\\nthat hung about the late inhabitants, had already raised.', 'Standing all\\nalone in the midst of the business and bustle of the street, the house\\nlooked a picture of cold desolation; and Kit, who remembered the\\ncheerful fire that used to burn there on a winter’s night and the no\\nless cheerful laugh that made the small room ring, turned quite\\nmournfully away.', 'It must be especially observed in justice to poor Kit that he was by no\\nmeans of a sentimental turn, and perhaps had never heard that adjective\\nin all his life.', 'He was only a soft-hearted grateful fellow, and had\\nnothing genteel or polite about him; consequently, instead of going\\nhome again, in his grief, to kick the children and abuse his mother\\n(for, when your finely strung people are out of sorts, they must have\\neverybody else unhappy likewise), he turned his thoughts to the vulgar\\nexpedient of making them more comfortable if he could.', 'Bless us, what a number of gentlemen on horseback there were riding up\\nand down, and how few of them wanted their horses held!', 'A good city\\nspeculator or a parliamentary commissioner could have told to a\\nfraction, from the crowds that were cantering about, what sum of money\\nwas realised in London, in the course of a year, by holding horses\\nalone.', 'And undoubtedly it would have been a very large one, if only a\\ntwentieth part of the gentlemen without grooms had had occasion to\\nalight; but they had not; and it is often an ill-natured circumstance\\nlike this, which spoils the most ingenious estimate in the world.', 'Kit walked about, now with quick steps and now with slow; now lingering\\nas some rider slackened his horse’s pace and looked about him; and now\\ndarting at full speed up a bye-street as he caught a glimpse of some\\ndistant horseman going lazily up the shady side of the road, and\\npromising to stop, at every door.', 'But on they all went, one after\\nanother, and there was not a penny stirring.', '‘I wonder,’ thought the\\nboy, ‘if one of these gentlemen knew there was nothing in the cupboard\\nat home, whether he’d stop on purpose, and make believe that he wanted\\nto call somewhere, that I might earn a trifle?’\\n\\nHe was quite tired out with pacing the streets, to say nothing of\\nrepeated disappointments, and was sitting down upon a step to rest,\\nwhen there approached towards him a little clattering jingling\\nfour-wheeled chaise, drawn by a little obstinate-looking rough-coated\\npony, and driven by a little fat placid-faced old gentleman.', 'Beside\\nthe little old gentleman sat a little old lady, plump and placid like\\nhimself, and the pony was coming along at his own pace and doing\\nexactly as he pleased with the whole concern.', 'If the old gentleman\\nremonstrated by shaking the reins, the pony replied by shaking his\\nhead.', 'It was plain that the utmost the pony would consent to do, was\\nto go in his own way up any street that the old gentleman particularly\\nwished to traverse, but that it was an understanding between them that\\nhe must do this after his own fashion or not at all.', 'As they passed where he sat, Kit looked so wistfully at the little\\nturn-out, that the old gentleman looked at him.', 'Kit rising and putting\\nhis hand to his hat, the old gentleman intimated to the pony that he\\nwished to stop, to which proposal the pony (who seldom objected to that\\npart of his duty) graciously acceded.', '‘I beg your pardon, sir,’ said Kit.', '‘I’m sorry you stopped, sir.', 'I\\nonly meant did you want your horse minded.’\\n\\n‘I’m going to get down in the next street,’ returned the old gentleman.', '‘If you like to come on after us, you may have the job.’\\n\\nKit thanked him, and joyfully obeyed.', 'The pony ran off at a sharp\\nangle to inspect a lamp-post on the opposite side of the way, and then\\nwent off at a tangent to another lamp-post on the other side.', 'Having\\nsatisfied himself that they were of the same pattern and materials, he\\ncame to a stop apparently absorbed in meditation.', '‘Will you go on, sir,’ said the old gentleman, gravely, ‘or are we to\\nwait here for you till it’s too late for our appointment?’\\n\\nThe pony remained immoveable.', '‘Oh you naughty Whisker,’ said the old lady.', '‘Fie upon you!', 'I’m\\nashamed of such conduct.’\\n\\nThe pony appeared to be touched by this appeal to his feelings, for he\\ntrotted on directly, though in a sulky manner, and stopped no more\\nuntil he came to a door whereon was a brass plate with the words\\n‘Witherden--Notary.’  Here the old gentleman got out and helped out the\\nold lady, and then took from under the seat a nosegay resembling in\\nshape and dimensions a full-sized warming-pan with the handle cut short\\noff.', 'This, the old lady carried into the house with a staid and\\nstately air, and the old gentleman (who had a club-foot) followed close\\nupon her.', 'They went, as it was easy to tell from the sound of their voices, into\\nthe front parlour, which seemed to be a kind of office.', 'The day being\\nvery warm and the street a quiet one, the windows were wide open; and\\nit was easy to hear through the Venetian blinds all that passed inside.', 'At first there was a great shaking of hands and shuffling of feet,\\nsucceeded by the presentation of the nosegay; for a voice, supposed by\\nthe listener to be that of Mr Witherden the Notary, was heard to\\nexclaim a great many times, ‘oh, delicious!’ ‘oh, fragrant, indeed!’\\nand a nose, also supposed to be the property of that gentleman, was\\nheard to inhale the scent with a snuffle of exceeding pleasure.', '‘I brought it in honour of the occasion, Sir,’ said the old lady.', '‘Ah!', 'an occasion indeed, ma’am, an occasion which does honour to me,\\nma’am, honour to me,’ rejoined Mr Witherden, the notary.', '‘I have had\\nmany a gentleman articled to me, ma’am, many a one.', 'Some of them are\\nnow rolling in riches, unmindful of their old companion and friend,\\nma’am, others are in the habit of calling upon me to this day and\\nsaying, “Mr Witherden, some of the pleasantest hours I ever spent in my\\nlife were spent in this office--were spent, Sir, upon this very stool”;\\nbut there was never one among the number, ma’am, attached as I have\\nbeen to many of them, of whom I augured such bright things as I do of\\nyour only son.’\\n\\n‘Oh dear!’ said the old lady.', '‘How happy you do make us when you tell\\nus that, to be sure!’\\n\\n‘I tell you, ma’am,’ said Mr Witherden, ‘what I think as an honest man,\\nwhich, as the poet observes, is the noblest work of God.', 'I agree with\\nthe poet in every particular, ma’am.', 'The mountainous Alps on the one\\nhand, or a humming-bird on the other, is nothing, in point of\\nworkmanship, to an honest man--or woman--or woman.’\\n\\n‘Anything that Mr Witherden can say of me,’ observed a small quiet\\nvoice, ‘I can say, with interest, of him, I am sure.’\\n\\n‘It’s a happy circumstance, a truly happy circumstance,’ said the\\nNotary, ‘to happen too upon his eight-and-twentieth birthday, and I\\nhope I know how to appreciate it.', 'I trust, Mr Garland, my dear Sir,\\nthat we may mutually congratulate each other upon this auspicious\\noccasion.’\\n\\nTo this the old gentleman replied that he felt assured they might.', 'There appeared to be another shaking of hands in consequence, and when\\nit was over, the old gentleman said that, though he said it who should\\nnot, he believed no son had ever been a greater comfort to his parents\\nthan Abel Garland had been to his.', '‘Marrying as his mother and I did, late in life, sir, after waiting for\\na great many years, until we were well enough off--coming together when\\nwe were no longer young, and then being blessed with one child who has\\nalways been dutiful and affectionate--why, it’s a source of great\\nhappiness to us both, sir.’\\n\\n‘Of course it is, I have no doubt of it,’ returned the Notary in a\\nsympathising voice.', '‘It’s the contemplation of this sort of thing,\\nthat makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor.', 'There was a young\\nlady once, sir, the daughter of an outfitting warehouse of the first\\nrespectability--but that’s a weakness.', 'Chuckster, bring in Mr Abel’s\\narticles.’\\n\\n‘You see, Mr Witherden,’ said the old lady, ‘that Abel has not been\\nbrought up like the run of young men.', 'He has always had a pleasure in\\nour society, and always been with us.', 'Abel has never been absent from\\nus, for a day; has he, my dear?’\\n\\n‘Never, my dear,’ returned the old gentleman, ‘except when he went to\\nMargate one Saturday with Mr Tomkinley that had been a teacher at that\\nschool he went to, and came back upon the Monday; but he was very ill\\nafter that, you remember, my dear; it was quite a dissipation.’\\n\\n‘He was not used to it, you know,’ said the old lady, ‘and he couldn’t\\nbear it, that’s the truth.', 'Besides he had no comfort in being there\\nwithout us, and had nobody to talk to or enjoy himself with.’\\n\\n‘That was it, you know,’ interposed the same small quiet voice that had\\nspoken once before.', '‘I was quite abroad, mother, quite desolate, and\\nto think that the sea was between us--oh, I never shall forget what I\\nfelt when I first thought that the sea was between us!’\\n\\n‘Very natural under the circumstances,’ observed the Notary.', '‘Mr\\nAbel’s feelings did credit to his nature, and credit to your nature,\\nma’am, and his father’s nature, and human nature.', 'I trace the same\\ncurrent now, flowing through all his quiet and unobtrusive\\nproceedings.--I am about to sign my name, you observe, at the foot of\\nthe articles which Mr Chuckster will witness; and placing my finger\\nupon this blue wafer with the vandyked corners, I am constrained to\\nremark in a distinct tone of voice--don’t be alarmed, ma’am, it is\\nmerely a form of law--that I deliver this, as my act and deed.', 'Mr Abel\\nwill place his name against the other wafer, repeating the same\\ncabalistic words, and the business is over.', 'Ha ha ha!', 'You see how\\neasily these things are done!’\\n\\nThere was a short silence, apparently, while Mr Abel went through the\\nprescribed form, and then the shaking of hands and shuffling of feet\\nwere renewed, and shortly afterwards there was a clinking of\\nwine-glasses and a great talkativeness on the part of everybody.', 'In\\nabout a quarter of an hour Mr Chuckster (with a pen behind his ear and\\nhis face inflamed with wine) appeared at the door, and condescending to\\naddress Kit by the jocose appellation of ‘Young Snob,’ informed him\\nthat the visitors were coming out.', 'Out they came forthwith; Mr Witherden, who was short, chubby,\\nfresh-coloured, brisk, and pompous, leading the old lady with extreme\\npoliteness, and the father and son following them, arm in arm.', 'Mr\\nAbel, who had a quaint old-fashioned air about him, looked nearly of\\nthe same age as his father, and bore a wonderful resemblance to him in\\nface and figure, though wanting something of his full, round,\\ncheerfulness, and substituting in its place a timid reserve.', 'In all\\nother respects, in the neatness of the dress, and even in the\\nclub-foot, he and the old gentleman were precisely alike.', 'Having seen the old lady safely in her seat, and assisted in the\\narrangement of her cloak and a small basket which formed an\\nindispensable portion of her equipage, Mr Abel got into a little box\\nbehind which had evidently been made for his express accommodation, and\\nsmiled at everybody present by turns, beginning with his mother and\\nending with the pony.', 'There was then a great to-do to make the pony\\nhold up his head that the bearing-rein might be fastened; at last even\\nthis was effected; and the old gentleman, taking his seat and the\\nreins, put his hand in his pocket to find a sixpence for Kit.', 'He had no sixpence, neither had the old lady, nor Mr Abel, nor the\\nNotary, nor Mr Chuckster.', 'The old gentleman thought a shilling too\\nmuch, but there was no shop in the street to get change at, so he gave\\nit to the boy.', '‘There,’ he said jokingly, ‘I’m coming here again next Monday at the\\nsame time, and mind you’re here, my lad, to work it out.’\\n\\n‘Thank you, Sir,’ said Kit.', '‘I’ll be sure to be here.’\\n\\nHe was quite serious, but they all laughed heartily at his saying so,\\nespecially Mr Chuckster, who roared outright and appeared to relish the\\njoke amazingly.', 'As the pony, with a presentiment that he was going\\nhome, or a determination that he would not go anywhere else (which was\\nthe same thing) trotted away pretty nimbly, Kit had no time to justify\\nhimself, and went his way also.', 'Having expended his treasure in such\\npurchases as he knew would be most acceptable at home, not forgetting\\nsome seed for the wonderful bird, he hastened back as fast as he could,\\nso elated with his success and great good fortune, that he more than\\nhalf expected Nell and the old man would have arrived before him.', 'CHAPTER 15\\n\\nOften, while they were yet pacing the silent streets of the town on the\\nmorning of their departure, the child trembled with a mingled sensation\\nof hope and fear as in some far-off figure imperfectly seen in the\\nclear distance, her fancy traced a likeness to honest Kit.', 'But\\nalthough she would gladly have given him her hand and thanked him for\\nwhat he had said at their last meeting, it was always a relief to find,\\nwhen they came nearer to each other, that the person who approached was\\nnot he, but a stranger; for even if she had not dreaded the effect\\nwhich the sight of him might have wrought upon her fellow-traveller,\\nshe felt that to bid farewell to anybody now, and most of all to him\\nwho had been so faithful and so true, was more than she could bear.', 'It\\nwas enough to leave dumb things behind, and objects that were\\ninsensible both to her love and sorrow.', 'To have parted from her only\\nother friend upon the threshold of that wild journey, would have wrung\\nher heart indeed.', 'Why is it that we can better bear to part in spirit than in body, and\\nwhile we have the fortitude to act farewell have not the nerve to say\\nit?', 'On the eve of long voyages or an absence of many years, friends\\nwho are tenderly attached will separate with the usual look, the usual\\npressure of the hand, planning one final interview for the morrow,\\nwhile each well knows that it is but a poor feint to save the pain of\\nuttering that one word, and that the meeting will never be.', 'Should\\npossibilities be worse to bear than certainties?', 'We do not shun our\\ndying friends; the not having distinctly taken leave of one among them,\\nwhom we left in all kindness and affection, will often embitter the\\nwhole remainder of a life.', 'The town was glad with morning light; places that had shown ugly and\\ndistrustful all night long, now wore a smile; and sparkling sunbeams\\ndancing on chamber windows, and twinkling through blind and curtain\\nbefore sleepers’ eyes, shed light even into dreams, and chased away the\\nshadows of the night.', 'Birds in hot rooms, covered up close and dark,\\nfelt it was morning, and chafed and grew restless in their little\\ncells; bright-eyed mice crept back to their tiny homes and nestled\\ntimidly together; the sleek house-cat, forgetful of her prey, sat\\nwinking at the rays of sun starting through keyhole and cranny in the\\ndoor, and longed for her stealthy run and warm sleek bask outside.', 'The\\nnobler beasts confined in dens, stood motionless behind their bars and\\ngazed on fluttering boughs, and sunshine peeping through some little\\nwindow, with eyes in which old forests gleamed--then trod impatiently\\nthe track their prisoned feet had worn--and stopped and gazed again.', 'Men in their dungeons stretched their cramp cold limbs and cursed the\\nstone that no bright sky could warm.', 'The flowers that sleep by night,\\nopened their gentle eyes and turned them to the day.', 'The light,\\ncreation’s mind, was everywhere, and all things owned its power.', 'The two pilgrims, often pressing each other’s hands, or exchanging a\\nsmile or cheerful look, pursued their way in silence.', 'Bright and happy\\nas it was, there was something solemn in the long, deserted streets,\\nfrom which, like bodies without souls, all habitual character and\\nexpression had departed, leaving but one dead uniform repose, that made\\nthem all alike.', 'All was so still at that early hour, that the few pale\\npeople whom they met seemed as much unsuited to the scene, as the\\nsickly lamp which had been here and there left burning, was powerless\\nand faint in the full glory of the sun.', 'Before they had penetrated very far into the labyrinth of men’s abodes\\nwhich yet lay between them and the outskirts, this aspect began to melt\\naway, and noise and bustle to usurp its place.', 'Some straggling carts\\nand coaches rumbling by, first broke the charm, then others came, then\\nothers yet more active, then a crowd.', 'The wonder was, at first, to see\\na tradesman’s window open, but it was a rare thing soon to see one\\nclosed; then, smoke rose slowly from the chimneys, and sashes were\\nthrown up to let in air, and doors were opened, and servant girls,\\nlooking lazily in all directions but their brooms, scattered brown\\nclouds of dust into the eyes of shrinking passengers, or listened\\ndisconsolately to milkmen who spoke of country fairs, and told of\\nwaggons in the mews, with awnings and all things complete, and gallant\\nswains to boot, which another hour would see upon their journey.', 'This quarter passed, they came upon the haunts of commerce and great\\ntraffic, where many people were resorting, and business was already\\nrife.', 'The old man looked about him with a startled and bewildered\\ngaze, for these were places that he hoped to shun.', 'He pressed his\\nfinger on his lip, and drew the child along by narrow courts and\\nwinding ways, nor did he seem at ease until they had left it far\\nbehind, often casting a backward look towards it, murmuring that ruin\\nand self-murder were crouching in every street, and would follow if\\nthey scented them; and that they could not fly too fast.', 'Again this quarter passed, they came upon a straggling neighbourhood,\\nwhere the mean houses parcelled off in rooms, and windows patched with\\nrags and paper, told of the populous poverty that sheltered there.', 'The\\nshops sold goods that only poverty could buy, and sellers and buyers\\nwere pinched and griped alike.', 'Here were poor streets where faded\\ngentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its\\nlast feeble stand, but tax-gatherer and creditor came there as\\nelsewhere, and the poverty that yet faintly struggled was hardly less\\nsqualid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given\\nup the game.', 'This was a wide, wide track--for the humble followers of the camp of\\nwealth pitch their tents round about it for many a mile--but its\\ncharacter was still the same.', 'Damp rotten houses, many to let, many\\nyet building, many half-built and mouldering away--lodgings, where it\\nwould be hard to tell which needed pity most, those who let or those\\nwho came to take--children, scantily fed and clothed, spread over every\\nstreet, and sprawling in the dust--scolding mothers, stamping their\\nslipshod feet with noisy threats upon the pavement--shabby fathers,\\nhurrying with dispirited looks to the occupation which brought them\\n‘daily bread’ and little more--mangling-women, washer-women, cobblers,\\ntailors, chandlers, driving their trades in parlours and kitchens and\\nback room and garrets, and sometimes all of them under the same\\nroof--brick-fields skirting gardens paled with staves of old casks, or\\ntimber pillaged from houses burnt down, and blackened and blistered by\\nthe flames--mounds of dock-weed, nettles, coarse grass and\\noyster-shells, heaped in rank confusion--small dissenting chapels to\\nteach, with no lack of illustration, the miseries of Earth, and plenty\\nof new churches, erected with a little superfluous wealth, to show the\\nway to Heaven.', 'At length these streets becoming more straggling yet, dwindled and\\ndwindled away, until there were only small garden patches bordering the\\nroad, with many a summer house innocent of paint and built of old\\ntimber or some fragments of a boat, green as the tough cabbage-stalks\\nthat grew about it, and grottoed at the seams with toad-stools and\\ntight-sticking snails.', 'To these succeeded pert cottages, two and two\\nwith plots of ground in front, laid out in angular beds with stiff box\\nborders and narrow paths between, where footstep never strayed to make\\nthe gravel rough.', 'Then came the public-house, freshly painted in green\\nand white, with tea-gardens and a bowling green, spurning its old\\nneighbour with the horse-trough where the waggons stopped; then,\\nfields; and then, some houses, one by one, of goodly size with lawns,\\nsome even with a lodge where dwelt a porter and his wife.', 'Then came a\\nturnpike; then fields again with trees and hay-stacks; then, a hill,\\nand on the top of that, the traveller might stop, and--looking back at\\nold Saint Paul’s looming through the smoke, its cross peeping above the\\ncloud (if the day were clear), and glittering in the sun; and casting\\nhis eyes upon the Babel out of which it grew until he traced it down to\\nthe furthest outposts of the invading army of bricks and mortar whose\\nstation lay for the present nearly at his feet--might feel at last that\\nhe was clear of London.', 'Near such a spot as this, and in a pleasant field, the old man and his\\nlittle guide (if guide she were, who knew not whither they were bound)\\nsat down to rest.', 'She had had the precaution to furnish her basket\\nwith some slices of bread and meat, and here they made their frugal\\nbreakfast.', 'The freshness of the day, the singing of the birds, the beauty of the\\nwaving grass, the deep green leaves, the wild flowers, and the thousand\\nexquisite scents and sounds that floated in the air--deep joys to most\\nof us, but most of all to those whose life is in a crowd or who live\\nsolitarily in great cities as in the bucket of a human well--sunk into\\ntheir breasts and made them very glad.', 'The child had repeated her\\nartless prayers once that morning, more earnestly perhaps than she had\\never done in all her life, but as she felt all this, they rose to her\\nlips again.', 'The old man took off his hat--he had no memory for the\\nwords--but he said amen, and that they were very good.', 'There had been an old copy of the Pilgrim’s Progress, with strange\\nplates, upon a shelf at home, over which she had often pored whole\\nevenings, wondering whether it was true in every word, and where those\\ndistant countries with the curious names might be.', 'As she looked back\\nupon the place they had left, one part of it came strongly on her mind.', '‘Dear grandfather,’ she said, ‘only that this place is prettier and a\\ngreat deal better than the real one, if that in the book is like it, I\\nfeel as if we were both Christian, and laid down on this grass all the\\ncares and troubles we brought with us; never to take them up again.’\\n\\n‘No--never to return--never to return’--replied the old man, waving his\\nhand towards the city.', '‘Thou and I are free of it now, Nell.', 'They\\nshall never lure us back.’\\n\\n‘Are you tired?’ said the child, ‘are you sure you don’t feel ill from\\nthis long walk?’\\n\\n‘I shall never feel ill again, now that we are once away,’ was his\\nreply.', '‘Let us be stirring, Nell.', 'We must be further away--a long,\\nlong way further.', 'We are too near to stop, and be at rest.', 'Come!’\\n\\nThere was a pool of clear water in the field, in which the child laved\\nher hands and face, and cooled her feet before setting forth to walk\\nagain.', 'She would have the old man refresh himself in this way too, and\\nmaking him sit down upon the grass, cast the water on him with her\\nhands, and dried it with her simple dress.', '‘I can do nothing for myself, my darling,’ said the grandfather; ‘I\\ndon’t know how it is, I could once, but the time’s gone.', 'Don’t leave\\nme, Nell; say that thou’lt not leave me.', 'I loved thee all the while,\\nindeed I did.', 'If I lose thee too, my dear, I must die!’\\n\\nHe laid his head upon her shoulder and moaned piteously.', 'The time had\\nbeen, and a very few days before, when the child could not have\\nrestrained her tears and must have wept with him.', 'But now she soothed\\nhim with gentle and tender words, smiled at his thinking they could\\never part, and rallied him cheerfully upon the jest.', 'He was soon\\ncalmed and fell asleep, singing to himself in a low voice, like a\\nlittle child.', 'He awoke refreshed, and they continued their journey.', 'The road was\\npleasant, lying between beautiful pastures and fields of corn, about\\nwhich, poised high in the clear blue sky, the lark trilled out her\\nhappy song.', 'The air came laden with the fragrance it caught upon its\\nway, and the bees, upborne upon its scented breath, hummed forth their\\ndrowsy satisfaction as they floated by.', 'They were now in the open country; the houses were very few and\\nscattered at long intervals, often miles apart.', 'Occasionally they came\\nupon a cluster of poor cottages, some with a chair or low board put\\nacross the open door to keep the scrambling children from the road,\\nothers shut up close while all the family were working in the fields.', 'These were often the commencement of a little village: and after an\\ninterval came a wheelwright’s shed or perhaps a blacksmith’s forge;\\nthen a thriving farm with sleepy cows lying about the yard, and horses\\npeering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses\\npassed upon the road, as though in triumph at their freedom.', 'There\\nwere dull pigs too, turning up the ground in search of dainty food, and\\ngrunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about, or crossed\\neach other in their quest; plump pigeons skimming round the roof or\\nstrutting on the eaves; and ducks and geese, far more graceful in their\\nown conceit, waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing\\nglibly on its surface.', 'The farm-yard passed, then came the little inn;\\nthe humbler beer-shop; and the village tradesman’s; then the lawyer’s\\nand the parson’s, at whose dread names the beer-shop trembled; the\\nchurch then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees; then there were\\na few more cottages; then the cage, and pound, and not unfrequently, on\\na bank by the way-side, a deep old dusty well.', 'Then came the\\ntrim-hedged fields on either hand, and the open road again.', 'They walked all day, and slept that night at a small cottage where beds\\nwere let to travellers.', 'Next morning they were afoot again, and though\\njaded at first, and very tired, recovered before long and proceeded\\nbriskly forward.', 'They often stopped to rest, but only for a short space at a time, and\\nstill kept on, having had but slight refreshment since the morning.', 'It\\nwas nearly five o’clock in the afternoon, when drawing near another\\ncluster of labourers’ huts, the child looked wistfully in each,\\ndoubtful at which to ask for permission to rest awhile, and buy a\\ndraught of milk.', 'It was not easy to determine, for she was timid and fearful of being\\nrepulsed.', 'Here was a crying child, and there a noisy wife.', 'In this,\\nthe people seemed too poor; in that, too many.', 'At length she stopped\\nat one where the family were seated round the table--chiefly because\\nthere was an old man sitting in a cushioned chair beside the hearth,\\nand she thought he was a grandfather and would feel for hers.', 'There were besides, the cottager and his wife, and three young sturdy\\nchildren, brown as berries.', 'The request was no sooner preferred, than\\ngranted.', 'The eldest boy ran out to fetch some milk, the second dragged\\ntwo stools towards the door, and the youngest crept to his mother’s\\ngown, and looked at the strangers from beneath his sunburnt hand.', '‘God save you, master,’ said the old cottager in a thin piping voice;\\n‘are you travelling far?’\\n\\n‘Yes, Sir, a long way’--replied the child; for her grandfather appealed\\nto her.', '‘From London?’ inquired the old man.', 'The child said yes.', 'Ah!', 'He had been in London many a time--used to go there often once,\\nwith waggons.', 'It was nigh two-and-thirty year since he had been there\\nlast, and he did hear say there were great changes.', 'Like enough!', 'He\\nhad changed, himself, since then.', 'Two-and-thirty year was a long time\\nand eighty-four a great age, though there was some he had known that\\nhad lived to very hard upon a hundred--and not so hearty as he,\\nneither--no, nothing like it.', '‘Sit thee down, master, in the elbow chair,’ said the old man, knocking\\nhis stick upon the brick floor, and trying to do so sharply.', '‘Take a\\npinch out o’ that box; I don’t take much myself, for it comes dear, but\\nI find it wakes me up sometimes, and ye’re but a boy to me.', 'I should\\nhave a son pretty nigh as old as you if he’d lived, but they listed him\\nfor a so’ger--he come back home though, for all he had but one poor\\nleg.', 'He always said he’d be buried near the sun-dial he used to climb\\nupon when he was a baby, did my poor boy, and his words come true--you\\ncan see the place with your own eyes; we’ve kept the turf up, ever\\nsince.’\\n\\nHe shook his head, and looking at his daughter with watery eyes, said\\nshe needn’t be afraid that he was going to talk about that, any more.', 'He didn’t wish to trouble nobody, and if he had troubled anybody by\\nwhat he said, he asked pardon, that was all.', 'The milk arrived, and the child producing her little basket, and\\nselecting its best fragments for her grandfather, they made a hearty\\nmeal.', 'The furniture of the room was very homely of course--a few rough\\nchairs and a table, a corner cupboard with their little stock of\\ncrockery and delf, a gaudy tea-tray, representing a lady in bright red,\\nwalking out with a very blue parasol, a few common, coloured scripture\\nsubjects in frames upon the wall and chimney, an old dwarf\\nclothes-press and an eight-day clock, with a few bright saucepans and a\\nkettle, comprised the whole.', 'But everything was clean and neat, and as\\nthe child glanced round, she felt a tranquil air of comfort and content\\nto which she had long been unaccustomed.', '‘How far is it to any town or village?’ she asked of the husband.', '‘A matter of good five mile, my dear,’ was the reply, ‘but you’re not\\ngoing on to-night?’\\n\\n‘Yes, yes, Nell,’ said the old man hastily, urging her too by signs.', '‘Further on, further on, darling, further away if we walk till\\nmidnight.’\\n\\n‘There’s a good barn hard by, master,’ said the man, ‘or there’s\\ntravellers’ lodging, I know, at the Plow an’ Harrer.', 'Excuse me, but\\nyou do seem a little tired, and unless you’re very anxious to get on--’\\n\\n‘Yes, yes, we are,’ returned the old man fretfully.', '‘Further away,\\ndear Nell, pray further away.’\\n\\n‘We must go on, indeed,’ said the child, yielding to his restless wish.', '‘We thank you very much, but we cannot stop so soon.', 'I’m quite ready,\\ngrandfather.’\\n\\nBut the woman had observed, from the young wanderer’s gait, that one of\\nher little feet was blistered and sore, and being a woman and a mother\\ntoo, she would not suffer her to go until she had washed the place and\\napplied some simple remedy, which she did so carefully and with such a\\ngentle hand--rough-grained and hard though it was, with work--that the\\nchild’s heart was too full to admit of her saying more than a fervent\\n‘God bless you!’ nor could she look back nor trust herself to speak,\\nuntil they had left the cottage some distance behind.', 'When she turned\\nher head, she saw that the whole family, even the old grandfather, were\\nstanding in the road watching them as they went, and so, with many\\nwaves of the hand, and cheering nods, and on one side at least not\\nwithout tears, they parted company.', 'They trudged forward, more slowly and painfully than they had done yet,\\nfor another mile or thereabouts, when they heard the sound of wheels\\nbehind them, and looking round observed an empty cart approaching\\npretty briskly.', 'The driver on coming up to them stopped his horse and\\nlooked earnestly at Nell.', '‘Didn’t you stop to rest at a cottage yonder?’ he said.', '‘Yes, sir,’ replied the child.', '‘Ah!', 'They asked me to look out for you,’ said the man.', '‘I’m going\\nyour way.', 'Give me your hand--jump up, master.’\\n\\nThis was a great relief, for they were very much fatigued and could\\nscarcely crawl along.', 'To them the jolting cart was a luxurious\\ncarriage, and the ride the most delicious in the world.', 'Nell had\\nscarcely settled herself on a little heap of straw in one corner, when\\nshe fell asleep, for the first time that day.', 'She was awakened by the stopping of the cart, which was about to turn\\nup a bye-lane.', 'The driver kindly got down to help her out, and\\npointing to some trees at a very short distance before them, said that\\nthe town lay there, and that they had better take the path which they\\nwould see leading through the churchyard.', 'Accordingly, towards this\\nspot, they directed their weary steps.', 'CHAPTER 16\\n\\nThe sun was setting when they reached the wicket-gate at which the path\\nbegan, and, as the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike, it shed\\nits warm tint even upon the resting-places of the dead, and bade them\\nbe of good hope for its rising on the morrow.', 'The church was old and\\ngrey, with ivy clinging to the walls, and round the porch.', 'Shunning\\nthe tombs, it crept about the mounds, beneath which slept poor humble\\nmen: twining for them the first wreaths they had ever won, but wreaths\\nless liable to wither and far more lasting in their kind, than some\\nwhich were graven deep in stone and marble, and told in pompous terms\\nof virtues meekly hidden for many a year, and only revealed at last to\\nexecutors and mourning legatees.', 'The clergyman’s horse, stumbling with a dull blunt sound among the\\ngraves, was cropping the grass; at once deriving orthodox consolation\\nfrom the dead parishioners, and enforcing last Sunday’s text that this\\nwas what all flesh came to; a lean ass who had sought to expound it\\nalso, without being qualified and ordained, was pricking his ears in an\\nempty pound hard by, and looking with hungry eyes upon his priestly\\nneighbour.', 'The old man and the child quitted the gravel path, and strayed among\\nthe tombs; for there the ground was soft, and easy to their tired feet.', 'As they passed behind the church, they heard voices near at hand, and\\npresently came on those who had spoken.', 'They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass, and\\nso busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders.', 'It was\\nnot difficult to divine that they were of a class of itinerant\\nshowmen--exhibitors of the freaks of Punch--for, perched cross-legged\\nupon a tombstone behind them, was a figure of that hero himself, his\\nnose and chin as hooked and his face as beaming as usual.', 'Perhaps his\\nimperturbable character was never more strikingly developed, for he\\npreserved his usual equable smile notwithstanding that his body was\\ndangling in a most uncomfortable position, all loose and limp and\\nshapeless, while his long peaked cap, unequally balanced against his\\nexceedingly slight legs, threatened every instant to bring him toppling\\ndown.', 'In part scattered upon the ground at the feet of the two men, and in\\npart jumbled together in a long flat box, were the other persons of the\\nDrama.', 'The hero’s wife and one child, the hobby-horse, the doctor, the\\nforeign gentleman who not being familiar with the language is unable in\\nthe representation to express his ideas otherwise than by the utterance\\nof the word ‘Shallabalah’ three distinct times, the radical neighbour\\nwho will by no means admit that a tin bell is an organ, the\\nexecutioner, and the devil, were all here.', 'Their owners had evidently\\ncome to that spot to make some needful repairs in the stage\\narrangements, for one of them was engaged in binding together a small\\ngallows with thread, while the other was intent upon fixing a new black\\nwig, with the aid of a small hammer and some tacks, upon the head of\\nthe radical neighbour, who had been beaten bald.', 'They raised their eyes when the old man and his young companion were\\nclose upon them, and pausing in their work, returned their looks of\\ncuriosity.', 'One of them, the actual exhibitor no doubt, was a little\\nmerry-faced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose, who seemed to have\\nunconsciously imbibed something of his hero’s character.', 'The\\nother--that was he who took the money--had rather a careful and\\ncautious look, which was perhaps inseparable from his occupation also.', 'The merry man was the first to greet the strangers with a nod; and\\nfollowing the old man’s eyes, he observed that perhaps that was the\\nfirst time he had ever seen a Punch off the stage.', '(Punch, it may be\\nremarked, seemed to be pointing with the tip of his cap to a most\\nflourishing epitaph, and to be chuckling over it with all his heart.)', '‘Why do you come here to do this?’ said the old man, sitting down\\nbeside them, and looking at the figures with extreme delight.', '‘Why you see,’ rejoined the little man, ‘we’re putting up for to-night\\nat the public-house yonder, and it wouldn’t do to let ‘em see the\\npresent company undergoing repair.’\\n\\n‘No!’ cried the old man, making signs to Nell to listen, ‘why not, eh?', 'why not?’\\n\\n‘Because it would destroy all the delusion, and take away all the\\ninterest, wouldn’t it?’ replied the little man.', '‘Would you care a\\nha’penny for the Lord Chancellor if you know’d him in private and\\nwithout his wig?--certainly not.’\\n\\n‘Good!’ said the old man, venturing to touch one of the puppets, and\\ndrawing away his hand with a shrill laugh.', '‘Are you going to show ‘em\\nto-night?', 'are you?’\\n\\n‘That is the intention, governor,’ replied the other, ‘and unless I’m\\nmuch mistaken, Tommy Codlin is a calculating at this minute what we’ve\\nlost through your coming upon us.', 'Cheer up, Tommy, it can’t be much.’\\n\\nThe little man accompanied these latter words with a wink, expressive\\nof the estimate he had formed of the travellers’ finances.', 'To this Mr Codlin, who had a surly, grumbling manner, replied, as he\\ntwitched Punch off the tombstone and flung him into the box, ‘I don’t\\ncare if we haven’t lost a farden, but you’re too free.', 'If you stood in\\nfront of the curtain and see the public’s faces as I do, you’d know\\nhuman natur’ better.’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'it’s been the spoiling of you, Tommy, your taking to that branch,’\\nrejoined his companion.', '‘When you played the ghost in the reg’lar\\ndrama in the fairs, you believed in everything--except ghosts.', 'But now\\nyou’re a universal mistruster.', 'I never see a man so changed.’\\n\\n‘Never mind,’ said Mr Codlin, with the air of a discontented\\nphilosopher.', '‘I know better now, and p’raps I’m sorry for it.’\\n\\nTurning over the figures in the box like one who knew and despised\\nthem, Mr Codlin drew one forth and held it up for the inspection of his\\nfriend:\\n\\n‘Look here; here’s all this judy’s clothes falling to pieces again.', 'You haven’t got a needle and thread I suppose?’\\n\\nThe little man shook his head, and scratched it ruefully as he\\ncontemplated this severe indisposition of a principal performer.', 'Seeing that they were at a loss, the child said timidly:\\n\\n‘I have a needle, Sir, in my basket, and thread too.', 'Will you let me\\ntry to mend it for you?', 'I think I could do it neater than you could.’\\n\\nEven Mr Codlin had nothing to urge against a proposal so seasonable.', 'Nelly, kneeling down beside the box, was soon busily engaged in her\\ntask, and accomplishing it to a miracle.', 'While she was thus engaged, the merry little man looked at her with an\\ninterest which did not appear to be diminished when he glanced at her\\nhelpless companion.', 'When she had finished her work he thanked her, and\\ninquired whither they were travelling.', '‘N--no further to-night, I think,’ said the child, looking towards her\\ngrandfather.', '‘If you’re wanting a place to stop at,’ the man remarked, ‘I should\\nadvise you to take up at the same house with us.', 'That’s it.', 'The long,\\nlow, white house there.', 'It’s very cheap.’\\n\\nThe old man, notwithstanding his fatigue, would have remained in the\\nchurchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too.', 'As he yielded to this suggestion a ready and rapturous assent, they all\\nrose and walked away together; he keeping close to the box of puppets\\nin which he was quite absorbed, the merry little man carrying it slung\\nover his arm by a strap attached to it for the purpose, Nelly having\\nhold of her grandfather’s hand, and Mr Codlin sauntering slowly behind,\\ncasting up at the church tower and neighbouring trees such looks as he\\nwas accustomed in town-practice to direct to drawing-room and nursery\\nwindows, when seeking for a profitable spot on which to plant the show.', 'The public-house was kept by a fat old landlord and landlady who made\\nno objection to receiving their new guests, but praised Nelly’s beauty\\nand were at once prepossessed in her behalf.', 'There was no other\\ncompany in the kitchen but the two showmen, and the child felt very\\nthankful that they had fallen upon such good quarters.', 'The landlady\\nwas very much astonished to learn that they had come all the way from\\nLondon, and appeared to have no little curiosity touching their farther\\ndestination.', 'The child parried her inquiries as well as she could, and\\nwith no great trouble, for finding that they appeared to give her pain,\\nthe old lady desisted.', '‘These two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hour’s time,’ she said,\\ntaking her into the bar; ‘and your best plan will be to sup with them.', 'Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something that’ll do you\\ngood, for I’m sure you must want it after all you’ve gone through\\nto-day.', 'Now, don’t look after the old gentleman, because when you’ve\\ndrank that, he shall have some too.’\\n\\nAs nothing could induce the child to leave him alone, however, or to\\ntouch anything in which he was not the first and greatest sharer, the\\nold lady was obliged to help him first.', 'When they had been thus\\nrefreshed, the whole house hurried away into an empty stable where the\\nshow stood, and where, by the light of a few flaring candles stuck\\nround a hoop which hung by a line from the ceiling, it was to be\\nforthwith exhibited.', 'And now Mr Thomas Codlin, the misanthrope, after blowing away at the\\nPan’s pipes until he was intensely wretched, took his station on one\\nside of the checked drapery which concealed the mover of the figures,\\nand putting his hands in his pockets prepared to reply to all questions\\nand remarks of Punch, and to make a dismal feint of being his most\\nintimate private friend, of believing in him to the fullest and most\\nunlimited extent, of knowing that he enjoyed day and night a merry and\\nglorious existence in that temple, and that he was at all times and\\nunder every circumstance the same intelligent and joyful person that\\nthe spectators then beheld him.', 'All this Mr Codlin did with the air of\\na man who had made up his mind for the worst and was quite resigned;\\nhis eye slowly wandering about during the briskest repartee to observe\\nthe effect upon the audience, and particularly the impression made upon\\nthe landlord and landlady, which might be productive of very important\\nresults in connexion with the supper.', 'Upon this head, however, he had no cause for any anxiety, for the whole\\nperformance was applauded to the echo, and voluntary contributions were\\nshowered in with a liberality which testified yet more strongly to the\\ngeneral delight.', 'Among the laughter none was more loud and frequent\\nthan the old man’s.', 'Nell’s was unheard, for she, poor child, with her\\nhead drooping on his shoulder, had fallen asleep, and slept too soundly\\nto be roused by any of his efforts to awaken her to a participation in\\nhis glee.', 'The supper was very good, but she was too tired to eat, and yet would\\nnot leave the old man until she had kissed him in his bed.', 'He, happily\\ninsensible to every care and anxiety, sat listening with a vacant smile\\nand admiring face to all that his new friend said; and it was not until\\nthey retired yawning to their room, that he followed the child up\\nstairs.', 'It was but a loft partitioned into two compartments, where they were to\\nrest, but they were well pleased with their lodging and had hoped for\\nnone so good.', 'The old man was uneasy when he had lain down, and begged\\nthat Nell would come and sit at his bedside as she had done for so many\\nnights.', 'She hastened to him, and sat there till he slept.', 'There was a little window, hardly more than a chink in the wall, in her\\nroom, and when she left him, she opened it, quite wondering at the\\nsilence.', 'The sight of the old church, and the graves about it in the\\nmoonlight, and the dark trees whispering among themselves, made her\\nmore thoughtful than before.', 'She closed the window again, and sitting\\ndown upon the bed, thought of the life that was before them.', 'She had a little money, but it was very little, and when that was gone,\\nthey must begin to beg.', 'There was one piece of gold among it, and an\\nemergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a\\nhundred fold.', 'It would be best to hide this coin, and never produce it\\nunless their case was absolutely desperate, and no other resource was\\nleft them.', 'Her resolution taken, she sewed the piece of gold into her dress, and\\ngoing to bed with a lighter heart sunk into a deep slumber.', 'CHAPTER 17\\n\\nAnother bright day shining in through the small casement, and claiming\\nfellowship with the kindred eyes of the child, awoke her.', 'At sight of\\nthe strange room and its unaccustomed objects she started up in alarm,\\nwondering how she had been moved from the familiar chamber in which she\\nseemed to have fallen asleep last night, and whither she had been\\nconveyed.', 'But, another glance around called to her mind all that had\\nlately passed, and she sprung from her bed, hoping and trustful.', 'It was yet early, and the old man being still asleep, she walked out\\ninto the churchyard, brushing the dew from the long grass with her\\nfeet, and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in\\nothers, that she might not tread upon the graves.', 'She felt a curious\\nkind of pleasure in lingering among these houses of the dead, and read\\nthe inscriptions on the tombs of the good people (a great number of\\ngood people were buried there), passing on from one to another with\\nincreasing interest.', 'It was a very quiet place, as such a place should be, save for the\\ncawing of the rooks who had built their nests among the branches of\\nsome tall old trees, and were calling to one another, high up in the\\nair.', 'First, one sleek bird, hovering near his ragged house as it swung\\nand dangled in the wind, uttered his hoarse cry, quite by chance as it\\nwould seem, and in a sober tone as though he were but talking to\\nhimself.', 'Another answered, and he called again, but louder than\\nbefore; then another spoke and then another; and each time the first,\\naggravated by contradiction, insisted on his case more strongly.', 'Other\\nvoices, silent till now, struck in from boughs lower down and higher up\\nand midway, and to the right and left, and from the tree-tops; and\\nothers, arriving hastily from the grey church turrets and old belfry\\nwindow, joined the clamour which rose and fell, and swelled and dropped\\nagain, and still went on; and all this noisy contention amidst a\\nskimming to and fro, and lighting on fresh branches, and frequent\\nchange of place, which satirised the old restlessness of those who lay\\nso still beneath the moss and turf below, and the strife in which they\\nhad worn away their lives.', 'Frequently raising her eyes to the trees whence these sounds came down,\\nand feeling as though they made the place more quiet than perfect\\nsilence would have done, the child loitered from grave to grave, now\\nstopping to replace with careful hands the bramble which had started\\nfrom some green mound it helped to keep in shape, and now peeping\\nthrough one of the low latticed windows into the church, with its\\nworm-eaten books upon the desks, and baize of whitened-green mouldering\\nfrom the pew sides and leaving the naked wood to view.', 'There were the\\nseats where the poor old people sat, worn spare, and yellow like\\nthemselves; the rugged font where children had their names, the homely\\naltar where they knelt in after life, the plain black tressels that\\nbore their weight on their last visit to the cool old shady church.', 'Everything told of long use and quiet slow decay; the very bell-rope in\\nthe porch was frayed into a fringe, and hoary with old age.', 'She was looking at a humble stone which told of a young man who had\\ndied at twenty-three years old, fifty-five years ago, when she heard a\\nfaltering step approaching, and looking round saw a feeble woman bent\\nwith the weight of years, who tottered to the foot of that same grave\\nand asked her to read the writing on the stone.', 'The old woman thanked\\nher when she had done, saying that she had had the words by heart for\\nmany a long, long year, but could not see them now.', '‘Were you his mother?’ said the child.', '‘I was his wife, my dear.’\\n\\nShe the wife of a young man of three-and-twenty!', 'Ah, true!', 'It was\\nfifty-five years ago.', '‘You wonder to hear me say that,’ remarked the old woman, shaking her\\nhead.', '‘You’re not the first.', 'Older folk than you have wondered at the\\nsame thing before now.', 'Yes, I was his wife.', 'Death doesn’t change us\\nmore than life, my dear.’\\n\\n‘Do you come here often?’ asked the child.', '‘I sit here very often in the summer time,’ she answered, ‘I used to\\ncome here once to cry and mourn, but that was a weary while ago, bless\\nGod!’\\n\\n‘I pluck the daisies as they grow, and take them home,’ said the old\\nwoman after a short silence.', '‘I like no flowers so well as these, and\\nhaven’t for five-and-fifty years.', 'It’s a long time, and I’m getting\\nvery old.’\\n\\nThen growing garrulous upon a theme which was new to one listener\\nthough it were but a child, she told her how she had wept and moaned\\nand prayed to die herself, when this happened; and how when she first\\ncame to that place, a young creature strong in love and grief, she had\\nhoped that her heart was breaking as it seemed to be.', 'But that time\\npassed by, and although she continued to be sad when she came there,\\nstill she could bear to come, and so went on until it was pain no\\nlonger, but a solemn pleasure, and a duty she had learned to like.', 'And\\nnow that five-and-fifty years were gone, she spoke of the dead man as\\nif he had been her son or grandson, with a kind of pity for his youth,\\ngrowing out of her own old age, and an exalting of his strength and\\nmanly beauty as compared with her own weakness and decay; and yet she\\nspoke about him as her husband too, and thinking of herself in\\nconnexion with him, as she used to be and not as she was now, talked of\\ntheir meeting in another world, as if he were dead but yesterday, and\\nshe, separated from her former self, were thinking of the happiness of\\nthat comely girl who seemed to have died with him.', 'The child left her gathering the flowers that grew upon the grave, and\\nthoughtfully retraced her steps.', 'The old man was by this time up and dressed.', 'Mr Codlin, still doomed\\nto contemplate the harsh realities of existence, was packing among his\\nlinen the candle-ends which had been saved from the previous night’s\\nperformance; while his companion received the compliments of all the\\nloungers in the stable-yard, who, unable to separate him from the\\nmaster-mind of Punch, set him down as next in importance to that merry\\noutlaw, and loved him scarcely less.', 'When he had sufficiently\\nacknowledged his popularity he came in to breakfast, at which meal they\\nall sat down together.', '‘And where are you going to-day?’ said the little man, addressing\\nhimself to Nell.', '‘Indeed I hardly know--we have not determined yet,’ replied the child.', '‘We’re going on to the races,’ said the little man.', '‘If that’s your\\nway and you like to have us for company, let us travel together.', 'If\\nyou prefer going alone, only say the word and you’ll find that we\\nshan’t trouble you.’\\n\\n‘We’ll go with you,’ said the old man.', '‘Nell--with them, with them.’\\n\\nThe child considered for a moment, and reflecting that she must shortly\\nbeg, and could scarcely hope to do so at a better place than where\\ncrowds of rich ladies and gentlemen were assembled together for\\npurposes of enjoyment and festivity, determined to accompany these men\\nso far.', 'She therefore thanked the little man for his offer, and said,\\nglancing timidly towards his friend, that if there was no objection to\\ntheir accompanying them as far as the race town--\\n\\n‘Objection!’ said the little man.', '‘Now be gracious for once, Tommy,\\nand say that you’d rather they went with us.', 'I know you would.', 'Be\\ngracious, Tommy.’\\n\\n‘Trotters,’ said Mr Codlin, who talked very slowly and ate very\\ngreedily, as is not uncommon with philosophers and misanthropes;\\n‘you’re too free.’\\n\\n‘Why what harm can it do?’ urged the other.', '‘No harm at all in this particular case, perhaps,’ replied Mr Codlin;\\n‘but the principle’s a dangerous one, and you’re too free I tell you.’\\n\\n‘Well, are they to go with us or not?’\\n\\n‘Yes, they are,’ said Mr Codlin; ‘but you might have made a favour of\\nit, mightn’t you?’\\n\\nThe real name of the little man was Harris, but it had gradually merged\\ninto the less euphonious one of Trotters, which, with the prefatory\\nadjective, Short, had been conferred upon him by reason of the small\\nsize of his legs.', 'Short Trotters however, being a compound name,\\ninconvenient of use in friendly dialogue, the gentleman on whom it had\\nbeen bestowed was known among his intimates either as ‘Short,’ or\\n‘Trotters,’ and was seldom accosted at full length as Short Trotters,\\nexcept in formal conversations and on occasions of ceremony.', 'Short, then, or Trotters, as the reader pleases, returned unto the\\nremonstrance of his friend Mr Thomas Codlin a jocose answer calculated\\nto turn aside his discontent; and applying himself with great relish to\\nthe cold boiled beef, the tea, and bread and butter, strongly impressed\\nupon his companions that they should do the like.', 'Mr Codlin indeed\\nrequired no such persuasion, as he had already eaten as much as he\\ncould possibly carry and was now moistening his clay with strong ale,\\nwhereof he took deep draughts with a silent relish and invited nobody\\nto partake--thus again strongly indicating his misanthropical turn of\\nmind.', 'Breakfast being at length over, Mr Codlin called the bill, and charging\\nthe ale to the company generally (a practice also savouring of\\nmisanthropy) divided the sum-total into two fair and equal parts,\\nassigning one moiety to himself and friend, and the other to Nelly and\\nher grandfather.', 'These being duly discharged and all things ready for\\ntheir departure, they took farewell of the landlord and landlady and\\nresumed their journey.', 'And here Mr Codlin’s false position in society and the effect it\\nwrought upon his wounded spirit, were strongly illustrated; for whereas\\nhe had been last night accosted by Mr Punch as ‘master,’ and had by\\ninference left the audience to understand that he maintained that\\nindividual for his own luxurious entertainment and delight, here he\\nwas, now, painfully walking beneath the burden of that same Punch’s\\ntemple, and bearing it bodily upon his shoulders on a sultry day and\\nalong a dusty road.', 'In place of enlivening his patron with a constant\\nfire of wit or the cheerful rattle of his quarter-staff on the heads of\\nhis relations and acquaintance, here was that beaming Punch utterly\\ndevoid of spine, all slack and drooping in a dark box, with his legs\\ndoubled up round his neck, and not one of his social qualities\\nremaining.', 'Mr Codlin trudged heavily on, exchanging a word or two at intervals\\nwith Short, and stopping to rest and growl occasionally.', 'Short led the\\nway; with the flat box, the private luggage (which was not extensive)\\ntied up in a bundle, and a brazen trumpet slung from his\\nshoulder-blade.', 'Nell and her grandfather walked next him on either\\nhand, and Thomas Codlin brought up the rear.', 'When they came to any town or village, or even to a detached house of\\ngood appearance, Short blew a blast upon the brazen trumpet and\\ncarolled a fragment of a song in that hilarious tone common to Punches\\nand their consorts.', 'If people hurried to the windows, Mr Codlin\\npitched the temple, and hastily unfurling the drapery and concealing\\nShort therewith, flourished hysterically on the pipes and performed an\\nair.', 'Then the entertainment began as soon as might be; Mr Codlin\\nhaving the responsibility of deciding on its length and of protracting\\nor expediting the time for the hero’s final triumph over the enemy of\\nmankind, according as he judged that the after-crop of half-pence would\\nbe plentiful or scant.', 'When it had been gathered in to the last\\nfarthing, he resumed his load and on they went again.', 'Sometimes they played out the toll across a bridge or ferry, and once\\nexhibited by particular desire at a turnpike, where the collector,\\nbeing drunk in his solitude, paid down a shilling to have it to\\nhimself.', 'There was one small place of rich promise in which their\\nhopes were blighted, for a favourite character in the play having\\ngold-lace upon his coat and being a meddling wooden-headed fellow was\\nheld to be a libel on the beadle, for which reason the authorities\\nenforced a quick retreat; but they were generally well received, and\\nseldom left a town without a troop of ragged children shouting at their\\nheels.', 'They made a long day’s journey, despite these interruptions, and were\\nyet upon the road when the moon was shining in the sky.', 'Short beguiled\\nthe time with songs and jests, and made the best of everything that\\nhappened.', 'Mr Codlin on the other hand, cursed his fate, and all the\\nhollow things of earth (but Punch especially), and limped along with\\nthe theatre on his back, a prey to the bitterest chagrin.', 'They had stopped to rest beneath a finger-post where four roads met,\\nand Mr Codlin in his deep misanthropy had let down the drapery and\\nseated himself in the bottom of the show, invisible to mortal eyes and\\ndisdainful of the company of his fellow creatures, when two monstrous\\nshadows were seen stalking towards them from a turning in the road by\\nwhich they had come.', 'The child was at first quite terrified by the\\nsight of these gaunt giants--for such they looked as they advanced with\\nlofty strides beneath the shadow of the trees--but Short, telling her\\nthere was nothing to fear, blew a blast upon the trumpet, which was\\nanswered by a cheerful shout.', '‘It’s Grinder’s lot, an’t it?’ cried Mr Short in a loud key.', '‘Yes,’ replied a couple of shrill voices.', '‘Come on then,’ said Short.', '‘Let’s have a look at you.', 'I thought it\\nwas you.’\\n\\nThus invited, ‘Grinder’s lot’ approached with redoubled speed and soon\\ncame up with the little party.', 'Mr Grinder’s company, familiarly termed a lot, consisted of a young\\ngentleman and a young lady on stilts, and Mr Grinder himself, who used\\nhis natural legs for pedestrian purposes and carried at his back a\\ndrum.', 'The public costume of the young people was of the Highland kind,\\nbut the night being damp and cold, the young gentleman wore over his\\nkilt a man’s pea jacket reaching to his ankles, and a glazed hat; the\\nyoung lady too was muffled in an old cloth pelisse and had a\\nhandkerchief tied about her head.', 'Their Scotch bonnets, ornamented\\nwith plumes of jet black feathers, Mr Grinder carried on his instrument.', '‘Bound for the races, I see,’ said Mr Grinder coming up out of breath.', '‘So are we.', 'How are you, Short?’  With that they shook hands in a very\\nfriendly manner.', 'The young people being too high up for the ordinary\\nsalutations, saluted Short after their own fashion.', 'The young\\ngentleman twisted up his right stilt and patted him on the shoulder,\\nand the young lady rattled her tambourine.', '‘Practice?’ said Short, pointing to the stilts.', '‘No,’ returned Grinder.', '‘It comes either to walkin’ in ‘em or carryin’\\nof ‘em, and they like walkin’ in ‘em best.', 'It’s wery pleasant for the\\nprospects.', 'Which road are you takin’?', 'We go the nighest.’\\n\\n‘Why, the fact is,’ said Short, ‘that we are going the longest way,\\nbecause then we could stop for the night, a mile and a half on.', 'But\\nthree or four mile gained to-night is so many saved to-morrow, and if\\nyou keep on, I think our best way is to do the same.’\\n\\n‘Where’s your partner?’ inquired Grinder.', '‘Here he is,’ cried Mr Thomas Codlin, presenting his head and face in\\nthe proscenium of the stage, and exhibiting an expression of\\ncountenance not often seen there; ‘and he’ll see his partner boiled\\nalive before he’ll go on to-night.', 'That’s what he says.’\\n\\n‘Well, don’t say such things as them, in a spear which is dewoted to\\nsomething pleasanter,’ urged Short.', '‘Respect associations, Tommy, even\\nif you do cut up rough.’\\n\\n‘Rough or smooth,’ said Mr Codlin, beating his hand on the little\\nfootboard where Punch, when suddenly struck with the symmetry of his\\nlegs and their capacity for silk stockings, is accustomed to exhibit\\nthem to popular admiration, ‘rough or smooth, I won’t go further than\\nthe mile and a half to-night.', 'I put up at the Jolly Sandboys and\\nnowhere else.', 'If you like to come there, come there.', 'If you like to\\ngo on by yourself, go on by yourself, and do without me if you can.’\\n\\nSo saying, Mr Codlin disappeared from the scene and immediately\\npresented himself outside the theatre, took it on his shoulders at a\\njerk, and made off with most remarkable agility.', 'Any further controversy being now out of the question, Short was fain\\nto part with Mr Grinder and his pupils and to follow his morose\\ncompanion.', 'After lingering at the finger-post for a few minutes to see\\nthe stilts frisking away in the moonlight and the bearer of the drum\\ntoiling slowly after them, he blew a few notes upon the trumpet as a\\nparting salute, and hastened with all speed to follow Mr Codlin.', 'With\\nthis view he gave his unoccupied hand to Nell, and bidding her be of\\ngood cheer as they would soon be at the end of their journey for that\\nnight, and stimulating the old man with a similar assurance, led them\\nat a pretty swift pace towards their destination, which he was the less\\nunwilling to make for, as the moon was now overcast and the clouds were\\nthreatening rain.', 'CHAPTER 18\\n\\nThe Jolly Sandboys was a small road-side inn of pretty ancient date,\\nwith a sign, representing three Sandboys increasing their jollity with\\nas many jugs of ale and bags of gold, creaking and swinging on its post\\non the opposite side of the road.', 'As the travellers had observed that\\nday many indications of their drawing nearer and nearer to the race\\ntown, such as gipsy camps, carts laden with gambling booths and their\\nappurtenances, itinerant showmen of various kinds, and beggars and\\ntrampers of every degree, all wending their way in the same direction,\\nMr Codlin was fearful of finding the accommodations forestalled; this\\nfear increasing as he diminished the distance between himself and the\\nhostelry, he quickened his pace, and notwithstanding the burden he had\\nto carry, maintained a round trot until he reached the threshold.', 'Here\\nhe had the gratification of finding that his fears were without\\nfoundation, for the landlord was leaning against the door-post looking\\nlazily at the rain, which had by this time begun to descend heavily,\\nand no tinkling of cracked bell, nor boisterous shout, nor noisy\\nchorus, gave note of company within.', '‘All alone?’ said Mr Codlin, putting down his burden and wiping his\\nforehead.', '‘All alone as yet,’ rejoined the landlord, glancing at the sky, ‘but we\\nshall have more company to-night I expect.', 'Here one of you boys, carry\\nthat show into the barn.', 'Make haste in out of the wet, Tom; when it\\ncame on to rain I told ‘em to make the fire up, and there’s a glorious\\nblaze in the kitchen, I can tell you.’\\n\\nMr Codlin followed with a willing mind, and soon found that the\\nlandlord had not commended his preparations without good reason.', 'A\\nmighty fire was blazing on the hearth and roaring up the wide chimney\\nwith a cheerful sound, which a large iron cauldron, bubbling and\\nsimmering in the heat, lent its pleasant aid to swell.', 'There was a\\ndeep red ruddy blush upon the room, and when the landlord stirred the\\nfire, sending the flames skipping and leaping up--when he took off the\\nlid of the iron pot and there rushed out a savoury smell, while the\\nbubbling sound grew deeper and more rich, and an unctuous steam came\\nfloating out, hanging in a delicious mist above their heads--when he\\ndid this, Mr Codlin’s heart was touched.', 'He sat down in the\\nchimney-corner and smiled.', 'Mr Codlin sat smiling in the chimney-corner, eyeing the landlord as\\nwith a roguish look he held the cover in his hand, and, feigning that\\nhis doing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery, suffered the\\ndelightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest.', 'The glow of the\\nfire was upon the landlord’s bald head, and upon his twinkling eye, and\\nupon his watering mouth, and upon his pimpled face, and upon his round\\nfat figure.', 'Mr Codlin drew his sleeve across his lips, and said in a\\nmurmuring voice, ‘What is it?’\\n\\n‘It’s a stew of tripe,’ said the landlord smacking his lips, ‘and\\ncow-heel,’ smacking them again, ‘and bacon,’ smacking them once more,\\n‘and steak,’ smacking them for the fourth time, ‘and peas,\\ncauliflowers, new potatoes, and sparrow-grass, all working up together\\nin one delicious gravy.’  Having come to the climax, he smacked his\\nlips a great many times, and taking a long hearty sniff of the\\nfragrance that was hovering about, put on the cover again with the air\\nof one whose toils on earth were over.', '‘At what time will it be ready?’ asked Mr Codlin faintly.', '‘It’ll be done to a turn,’ said the landlord looking up to the\\nclock--and the very clock had a colour in its fat white face, and\\nlooked a clock for jolly Sandboys to consult--‘it’ll be done to a turn\\nat twenty-two minutes before eleven.’\\n\\n‘Then,’ said Mr Codlin, ‘fetch me a pint of warm ale, and don’t let\\nnobody bring into the room even so much as a biscuit till the time\\narrives.’\\n\\nNodding his approval of this decisive and manly course of procedure,\\nthe landlord retired to draw the beer, and presently returning with it,\\napplied himself to warm the same in a small tin vessel shaped\\nfunnel-wise, for the convenience of sticking it far down in the fire\\nand getting at the bright places.', 'This was soon done, and he handed it\\nover to Mr Codlin with that creamy froth upon the surface which is one\\nof the happy circumstances attendant on mulled malt.', 'Greatly softened by this soothing beverage, Mr Codlin now bethought him\\nof his companions, and acquainted mine host of the Sandboys that their\\narrival might be shortly looked for.', 'The rain was rattling against the\\nwindows and pouring down in torrents, and such was Mr Codlin’s extreme\\namiability of mind, that he more than once expressed his earnest hope\\nthat they would not be so foolish as to get wet.', 'At length they arrived, drenched with the rain and presenting a most\\nmiserable appearance, notwithstanding that Short had sheltered the\\nchild as well as he could under the skirts of his own coat, and they\\nwere nearly breathless from the haste they had made.', 'But their steps\\nwere no sooner heard upon the road than the landlord, who had been at\\nthe outer door anxiously watching for their coming, rushed into the\\nkitchen and took the cover off.', 'The effect was electrical.', 'They all\\ncame in with smiling faces though the wet was dripping from their\\nclothes upon the floor, and Short’s first remark was, ‘What a delicious\\nsmell!’\\n\\nIt is not very difficult to forget rain and mud by the side of a\\ncheerful fire, and in a bright room.', 'They were furnished with slippers\\nand such dry garments as the house or their own bundles afforded, and\\nensconcing themselves, as Mr Codlin had already done, in the warm\\nchimney-corner, soon forgot their late troubles or only remembered them\\nas enhancing the delights of the present time.', 'Overpowered by the\\nwarmth and comfort and the fatigue they had undergone, Nelly and the\\nold man had not long taken their seats here, when they fell asleep.', '‘Who are they?’ whispered the landlord.', 'Short shook his head, and wished he knew himself.', '‘Don’t you know?’ asked the host, turning to Mr Codlin.', '‘Not I,’ he replied.', '‘They’re no good, I suppose.’\\n\\n‘They’re no harm,’ said Short.', '‘Depend upon that.', 'I tell you\\nwhat--it’s plain that the old man an’t in his right mind--’\\n\\n‘If you haven’t got anything newer than that to say,’ growled Mr\\nCodlin, glancing at the clock, ‘you’d better let us fix our minds upon\\nthe supper, and not disturb us.’\\n\\n‘Hear me out, won’t you?’ retorted his friend.', '‘It’s very plain to me,\\nbesides, that they’re not used to this way of life.', 'Don’t tell me that\\nthat handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she’s\\ndone these last two or three days.', 'I know better.’\\n\\n‘Well, who DOES tell you she has?’ growled Mr Codlin, again glancing at\\nthe clock and from it to the cauldron, ‘can’t you think of anything\\nmore suitable to present circumstances than saying things and then\\ncontradicting ‘em?’\\n\\n‘I wish somebody would give you your supper,’ returned Short, ‘for\\nthere’ll be no peace till you’ve got it.', 'Have you seen how anxious the\\nold man is to get on--always wanting to be furder away--furder away.', 'Have you seen that?’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'what then?’ muttered Thomas Codlin.', '‘This, then,’ said Short.', '‘He has given his friends the slip.', 'Mind\\nwhat I say--he has given his friends the slip, and persuaded this\\ndelicate young creetur all along of her fondness for him to be his\\nguide and travelling companion--where to, he knows no more than the man\\nin the moon.', 'Now I’m not a going to stand that.’\\n\\n‘YOU’RE not a going to stand that!’ cried Mr Codlin, glancing at the\\nclock again and pulling his hair with both hands in a kind of frenzy,\\nbut whether occasioned by his companion’s observation or the tardy pace\\nof Time, it was difficult to determine.', '‘Here’s a world to live in!’\\n\\n‘I,’ repeated Short emphatically and slowly, ‘am not a-going to stand\\nit.', 'I am not a-going to see this fair young child a falling into bad\\nhands, and getting among people that she’s no more fit for, than they\\nare to get among angels as their ordinary chums.', 'Therefore when they\\ndewelope an intention of parting company from us, I shall take measures\\nfor detaining of ‘em, and restoring ‘em to their friends, who I dare\\nsay have had their disconsolation pasted up on every wall in London by\\nthis time.’\\n\\n‘Short,’ said Mr Codlin, who with his head upon his hands, and his\\nelbows on his knees, had been shaking himself impatiently from side to\\nside up to this point and occasionally stamping on the ground, but who\\nnow looked up with eager eyes; ‘it’s possible that there may be\\nuncommon good sense in what you’ve said.', 'If there is, and there should\\nbe a reward, Short, remember that we’re partners in everything!’\\n\\nHis companion had only time to nod a brief assent to this position, for\\nthe child awoke at the instant.', 'They had drawn close together during\\nthe previous whispering, and now hastily separated and were rather\\nawkwardly endeavouring to exchange some casual remarks in their usual\\ntone, when strange footsteps were heard without, and fresh company\\nentered.', 'These were no other than four very dismal dogs, who came pattering in\\none after the other, headed by an old bandy dog of particularly\\nmournful aspect, who, stopping when the last of his followers had got\\nas far as the door, erected himself upon his hind legs and looked round\\nat his companions, who immediately stood upon their hind legs, in a\\ngrave and melancholy row.', 'Nor was this the only remarkable\\ncircumstance about these dogs, for each of them wore a kind of little\\ncoat of some gaudy colour trimmed with tarnished spangles, and one of\\nthem had a cap upon his head, tied very carefully under his chin, which\\nhad fallen down upon his nose and completely obscured one eye; add to\\nthis, that the gaudy coats were all wet through and discoloured with\\nrain, and that the wearers were splashed and dirty, and some idea may\\nbe formed of the unusual appearance of these new visitors to the Jolly\\nSandboys.', 'Neither Short nor the landlord nor Thomas Codlin, however, was in the\\nleast surprised, merely remarking that these were Jerry’s dogs and that\\nJerry could not be far behind.', 'So there the dogs stood, patiently\\nwinking and gaping and looking extremely hard at the boiling pot, until\\nJerry himself appeared, when they all dropped down at once and walked\\nabout the room in their natural manner.', 'This posture it must be\\nconfessed did not much improve their appearance, as their own personal\\ntails and their coat tails--both capital things in their way--did not\\nagree together.', 'Jerry, the manager of these dancing dogs, was a tall black-whiskered\\nman in a velveteen coat, who seemed well known to the landlord and his\\nguests and accosted them with great cordiality.', 'Disencumbering himself\\nof a barrel organ which he placed upon a chair, and retaining in his\\nhand a small whip wherewith to awe his company of comedians, he came up\\nto the fire to dry himself, and entered into conversation.', '‘Your people don’t usually travel in character, do they?’ said Short,\\npointing to the dresses of the dogs.', '‘It must come expensive if they\\ndo?’\\n\\n‘No,’ replied Jerry, ‘no, it’s not the custom with us.', 'But we’ve been\\nplaying a little on the road to-day, and we come out with a new\\nwardrobe at the races, so I didn’t think it worth while to stop to\\nundress.', 'Down, Pedro!’\\n\\nThis was addressed to the dog with the cap on, who being a new member\\nof the company, and not quite certain of his duty, kept his unobscured\\neye anxiously on his master, and was perpetually starting upon his hind\\nlegs when there was no occasion, and falling down again.', '‘I’ve got a animal here,’ said Jerry, putting his hand into the\\ncapacious pocket of his coat, and diving into one corner as if he were\\nfeeling for a small orange or an apple or some such article, ‘a animal\\nhere, wot I think you know something of, Short.’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ cried Short, ‘let’s have a look at him.’\\n\\n‘Here he is,’ said Jerry, producing a little terrier from his pocket.', '‘He was once a Toby of yours, warn’t he!’\\n\\nIn some versions of the great drama of Punch there is a small dog--a\\nmodern innovation--supposed to be the private property of that\\ngentleman, whose name is always Toby.', 'This Toby has been stolen in\\nyouth from another gentleman, and fraudulently sold to the confiding\\nhero, who having no guile himself has no suspicion that it lurks in\\nothers; but Toby, entertaining a grateful recollection of his old\\nmaster, and scorning to attach himself to any new patrons, not only\\nrefuses to smoke a pipe at the bidding of Punch, but to mark his old\\nfidelity more strongly, seizes him by the nose and wrings the same with\\nviolence, at which instance of canine attachment the spectators are\\ndeeply affected.', 'This was the character which the little terrier in\\nquestion had once sustained; if there had been any doubt upon the\\nsubject he would speedily have resolved it by his conduct; for not only\\ndid he, on seeing Short, give the strongest tokens of recognition, but\\ncatching sight of the flat box he barked so furiously at the pasteboard\\nnose which he knew was inside, that his master was obliged to gather\\nhim up and put him into his pocket again, to the great relief of the\\nwhole company.', 'The landlord now busied himself in laying the cloth, in which process\\nMr Codlin obligingly assisted by setting forth his own knife and fork\\nin the most convenient place and establishing himself behind them.', 'When everything was ready, the landlord took off the cover for the last\\ntime, and then indeed there burst forth such a goodly promise of\\nsupper, that if he had offered to put it on again or had hinted at\\npostponement, he would certainly have been sacrificed on his own hearth.', 'However, he did nothing of the kind, but instead thereof assisted a\\nstout servant girl in turning the contents of the cauldron into a large\\ntureen; a proceeding which the dogs, proof against various hot splashes\\nwhich fell upon their noses, watched with terrible eagerness.', 'At\\nlength the dish was lifted on the table, and mugs of ale having been\\npreviously set round, little Nell ventured to say grace, and supper\\nbegan.', 'At this juncture the poor dogs were standing on their hind legs quite\\nsurprisingly; the child, having pity on them, was about to cast some\\nmorsels of food to them before she tasted it herself, hungry though she\\nwas, when their master interposed.', '‘No, my dear, no, not an atom from anybody’s hand but mine if you\\nplease.', 'That dog,’ said Jerry, pointing out the old leader of the\\ntroop, and speaking in a terrible voice, ‘lost a halfpenny to-day.', 'He\\ngoes without his supper.’\\n\\nThe unfortunate creature dropped upon his fore-legs directly, wagged\\nhis tail, and looked imploringly at his master.', '‘You must be more careful, Sir,’ said Jerry, walking coolly to the\\nchair where he had placed the organ, and setting the stop.', '‘Come here.', 'Now, Sir, you play away at that, while we have supper, and leave off if\\nyou dare.’\\n\\nThe dog immediately began to grind most mournful music.', 'His master\\nhaving shown him the whip resumed his seat and called up the others,\\nwho, at his directions, formed in a row, standing upright as a file of\\nsoldiers.', '‘Now, gentlemen,’ said Jerry, looking at them attentively.', '‘The dog\\nwhose name’s called, eats.', 'The dogs whose names an’t called, keep\\nquiet.', 'Carlo!’\\n\\nThe lucky individual whose name was called, snapped up the morsel\\nthrown towards him, but none of the others moved a muscle.', 'In this\\nmanner they were fed at the discretion of their master.', 'Meanwhile the\\ndog in disgrace ground hard at the organ, sometimes in quick time,\\nsometimes in slow, but never leaving off for an instant.', 'When the\\nknives and forks rattled very much, or any of his fellows got an\\nunusually large piece of fat, he accompanied the music with a short\\nhowl, but he immediately checked it on his master looking round, and\\napplied himself with increased diligence to the Old Hundredth.', 'CHAPTER 19\\n\\nSupper was not yet over, when there arrived at the Jolly Sandboys two\\nmore travellers bound for the same haven as the rest, who had been\\nwalking in the rain for some hours, and came in shining and heavy with\\nwater.', 'One of these was the proprietor of a giant, and a little lady\\nwithout legs or arms, who had jogged forward in a van; the other, a\\nsilent gentleman who earned his living by showing tricks upon the\\ncards, and who had rather deranged the natural expression of his\\ncountenance by putting small leaden lozenges into his eyes and bringing\\nthem out at his mouth, which was one of his professional\\naccomplishments.', 'The name of the first of these newcomers was Vuffin;\\nthe other, probably as a pleasant satire upon his ugliness, was called\\nSweet William.', 'To render them as comfortable as he could, the landlord\\nbestirred himself nimbly, and in a very short time both gentlemen were\\nperfectly at their ease.', '‘How’s the Giant?’ said Short, when they all sat smoking round the fire.', '‘Rather weak upon his legs,’ returned Mr Vuffin.', '‘I begin to be afraid\\nhe’s going at the knees.’\\n\\n‘That’s a bad look-out,’ said Short.', '‘Aye!', 'Bad indeed,’ replied Mr Vuffin, contemplating the fire with a\\nsigh.', '‘Once get a giant shaky on his legs, and the public care no more\\nabout him than they do for a dead cabbage stalk.’\\n\\n‘What becomes of old giants?’ said Short, turning to him again after a\\nlittle reflection.', '‘They’re usually kept in carawans to wait upon the dwarfs,’ said Mr\\nVuffin.', '‘The maintaining of ‘em must come expensive, when they can’t be shown,\\neh?’ remarked Short, eyeing him doubtfully.', '‘It’s better that, than letting ‘em go upon the parish or about the\\nstreets,’ said Mr Vuffin.', '‘Once make a giant common and giants will\\nnever draw again.', 'Look at wooden legs.', 'If there was only one man with\\na wooden leg what a property he’d be!’\\n\\n‘So he would!’ observed the landlord and Short both together.', '‘That’s\\nvery true.’\\n\\n‘Instead of which,’ pursued Mr Vuffin, ‘if you was to advertise\\nShakspeare played entirely by wooden legs, it’s my belief you wouldn’t\\ndraw a sixpence.’\\n\\n‘I don’t suppose you would,’ said Short.', 'And the landlord said so too.', '‘This shows, you see,’ said Mr Vuffin, waving his pipe with an\\nargumentative air, ‘this shows the policy of keeping the used-up giants\\nstill in the carawans, where they get food and lodging for nothing, all\\ntheir lives, and in general very glad they are to stop there.', 'There\\nwas one giant--a black ‘un--as left his carawan some year ago and took\\nto carrying coach-bills about London, making himself as cheap as\\ncrossing-sweepers.', 'He died.', 'I make no insinuation against anybody in\\nparticular,’ said Mr Vuffin, looking solemnly round, ‘but he was\\nruining the trade;--and he died.’\\n\\nThe landlord drew his breath hard, and looked at the owner of the dogs,\\nwho nodded and said gruffly that he remembered.', '‘I know you do, Jerry,’ said Mr Vuffin with profound meaning.', '‘I know\\nyou remember it, Jerry, and the universal opinion was, that it served\\nhim right.', 'Why, I remember the time when old Maunders as had\\nthree-and-twenty wans--I remember the time when old Maunders had in his\\ncottage in Spa Fields in the winter time, when the season was over,\\neight male and female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day, who was\\nwaited on by eight old giants in green coats, red smalls, blue cotton\\nstockings, and high-lows: and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly\\nand wicious who whenever his giant wasn’t quick enough to please him,\\nused to stick pins in his legs, not being able to reach up any higher.', 'I know that’s a fact, for Maunders told it me himself.’\\n\\n‘What about the dwarfs when they get old?’ inquired the landlord.', '‘The older a dwarf is, the better worth he is,’ returned Mr Vuffin; ‘a\\ngrey-headed dwarf, well wrinkled, is beyond all suspicion.', 'But a giant\\nweak in the legs and not standing upright!--keep him in the carawan,\\nbut never show him, never show him, for any persuasion that can be\\noffered.’\\n\\nWhile Mr Vuffin and his two friends smoked their pipes and beguiled the\\ntime with such conversation as this, the silent gentleman sat in a warm\\ncorner, swallowing, or seeming to swallow, sixpennyworth of halfpence\\nfor practice, balancing a feather upon his nose, and rehearsing other\\nfeats of dexterity of that kind, without paying any regard whatever to\\nthe company, who in their turn left him utterly unnoticed.', 'At length\\nthe weary child prevailed upon her grandfather to retire, and they\\nwithdrew, leaving the company yet seated round the fire, and the dogs\\nfast asleep at a humble distance.', 'After bidding the old man good night, Nell retired to her poor garret,\\nbut had scarcely closed the door, when it was gently tapped at.', 'She\\nopened it directly, and was a little startled by the sight of Mr Thomas\\nCodlin, whom she had left, to all appearance, fast asleep down stairs.', '‘What is the matter?’ said the child.', '‘Nothing’s the matter, my dear,’ returned her visitor.', '‘I’m your\\nfriend.', 'Perhaps you haven’t thought so, but it’s me that’s your\\nfriend--not him.’\\n\\n‘Not who?’ the child inquired.', '‘Short, my dear.', 'I tell you what,’ said Codlin, ‘for all his having a\\nkind of way with him that you’d be very apt to like, I’m the real,\\nopen-hearted man.', 'I mayn’t look it, but I am indeed.’\\n\\nThe child began to be alarmed, considering that the ale had taken\\neffect upon Mr Codlin, and that this commendation of himself was the\\nconsequence.', '‘Short’s very well, and seems kind,’ resumed the misanthrope, ‘but he\\noverdoes it.', 'Now I don’t.’\\n\\nCertainly if there were any fault in Mr Codlin’s usual deportment, it\\nwas that he rather underdid his kindness to those about him, than\\noverdid it.', 'But the child was puzzled, and could not tell what to say.', '‘Take my advice,’ said Codlin: ‘don’t ask me why, but take it.', 'As long\\nas you travel with us, keep as near me as you can.', 'Don’t offer to\\nleave us--not on any account--but always stick to me and say that I’m\\nyour friend.', 'Will you bear that in mind, my dear, and always say that\\nit was me that was your friend?’\\n\\n‘Say so where--and when?’ inquired the child innocently.', '‘O, nowhere in particular,’ replied Codlin, a little put out as it\\nseemed by the question; ‘I’m only anxious that you should think me so,\\nand do me justice.', 'You can’t think what an interest I have in you.', 'Why didn’t you tell me your little history--that about you and the poor\\nold gentleman?', 'I’m the best adviser that ever was, and so interested\\nin you--so much more interested than Short.', 'I think they’re breaking\\nup down stairs; you needn’t tell Short, you know, that we’ve had this\\nlittle talk together.', 'God bless you.', 'Recollect the friend.', 'Codlin’s\\nthe friend, not Short.', 'Short’s very well as far as he goes, but the\\nreal friend is Codlin--not Short.’\\n\\nEking out these professions with a number of benevolent and protecting\\nlooks and great fervour of manner, Thomas Codlin stole away on tiptoe,\\nleaving the child in a state of extreme surprise.', 'She was still\\nruminating upon his curious behaviour, when the floor of the crazy\\nstairs and landing cracked beneath the tread of the other travellers\\nwho were passing to their beds.', 'When they had all passed, and the\\nsound of their footsteps had died away, one of them returned, and after\\na little hesitation and rustling in the passage, as if he were doubtful\\nwhat door to knock at, knocked at hers.', '‘Yes,’ said the child from within.', '‘It’s me--Short’--a voice called through the keyhole.', '‘I only wanted\\nto say that we must be off early to-morrow morning, my dear, because\\nunless we get the start of the dogs and the conjuror, the villages\\nwon’t be worth a penny.', 'You’ll be sure to be stirring early and go\\nwith us?', 'I’ll call you.’\\n\\nThe child answered in the affirmative, and returning his ‘good night’\\nheard him creep away.', 'She felt some uneasiness at the anxiety of these\\nmen, increased by the recollection of their whispering together down\\nstairs and their slight confusion when she awoke, nor was she quite\\nfree from a misgiving that they were not the fittest companions she\\ncould have stumbled on.', 'Her uneasiness, however, was nothing, weighed\\nagainst her fatigue; and she soon forgot it in sleep.', 'Very early next morning, Short fulfilled his promise, and knocking\\nsoftly at her door, entreated that she would get up directly, as the\\nproprietor of the dogs was still snoring, and if they lost no time they\\nmight get a good deal in advance both of him and the conjuror, who was\\ntalking in his sleep, and from what he could be heard to say, appeared\\nto be balancing a donkey in his dreams.', 'She started from her bed\\nwithout delay, and roused the old man with so much expedition that they\\nwere both ready as soon as Short himself, to that gentleman’s\\nunspeakable gratification and relief.', 'After a very unceremonious and scrambling breakfast, of which the\\nstaple commodities were bacon and bread, and beer, they took leave of\\nthe landlord and issued from the door of the jolly Sandboys.', 'The\\nmorning was fine and warm, the ground cool to the feet after the late\\nrain, the hedges gayer and more green, the air clear, and everything\\nfresh and healthful.', 'Surrounded by these influences, they walked on\\npleasantly enough.', 'They had not gone very far, when the child was again struck by the\\naltered behaviour of Mr Thomas Codlin, who instead of plodding on\\nsulkily by himself as he had heretofore done, kept close to her, and\\nwhen he had an opportunity of looking at her unseen by his companion,\\nwarned her by certain wry faces and jerks of the head not to put any\\ntrust in Short, but to reserve all confidences for Codlin.', 'Neither did\\nhe confine himself to looks and gestures, for when she and her\\ngrandfather were walking on beside the aforesaid Short, and that little\\nman was talking with his accustomed cheerfulness on a variety of\\nindifferent subjects, Thomas Codlin testified his jealousy and distrust\\nby following close at her heels, and occasionally admonishing her\\nankles with the legs of the theatre in a very abrupt and painful manner.', 'All these proceedings naturally made the child more watchful and\\nsuspicious, and she soon observed that whenever they halted to perform\\noutside a village alehouse or other place, Mr Codlin while he went\\nthrough his share of the entertainments kept his eye steadily upon her\\nand the old man, or with a show of great friendship and consideration\\ninvited the latter to lean upon his arm, and so held him tight until\\nthe representation was over and they again went forward.', 'Even Short\\nseemed to change in this respect, and to mingle with his good-nature\\nsomething of a desire to keep them in safe custody.', 'This increased the\\nchild’s misgivings, and made her yet more anxious and uneasy.', 'Meanwhile, they were drawing near the town where the races were to\\nbegin next day; for, from passing numerous groups of gipsies and\\ntrampers on the road, wending their way towards it, and straggling out\\nfrom every by-way and cross-country lane, they gradually fell into a\\nstream of people, some walking by the side of covered carts, others\\nwith horses, others with donkeys, others toiling on with heavy loads\\nupon their backs, but all tending to the same point.', 'The public-houses\\nby the wayside, from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter\\nparts had been, now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke;\\nand, from the misty windows, clusters of broad red faces looked down\\nupon the road.', 'On every piece of waste or common ground, some small\\ngambler drove his noisy trade, and bellowed to the idle passersby to\\nstop and try their chance; the crowd grew thicker and more noisy; gilt\\ngingerbread in blanket-stalls exposed its glories to the dust; and\\noften a four-horse carriage, dashing by, obscured all objects in the\\ngritty cloud it raised, and left them, stunned and blinded, far behind.', 'It was dark before they reached the town itself, and long indeed the\\nfew last miles had been.', 'Here all was tumult and confusion; the\\nstreets were filled with throngs of people--many strangers were there,\\nit seemed, by the looks they cast about--the church-bells rang out\\ntheir noisy peals, and flags streamed from windows and house-tops.', 'In\\nthe large inn-yards waiters flitted to and fro and ran against each\\nother, horses clattered on the uneven stones, carriage steps fell\\nrattling down, and sickening smells from many dinners came in a heavy\\nlukewarm breath upon the sense.', 'In the smaller public-houses, fiddles\\nwith all their might and main were squeaking out the tune to staggering\\nfeet; drunken men, oblivious of the burden of their song, joined in a\\nsenseless howl, which drowned the tinkling of the feeble bell and made\\nthem savage for their drink; vagabond groups assembled round the doors\\nto see the stroller woman dance, and add their uproar to the shrill\\nflageolet and deafening drum.', 'Through this delirious scene, the child, frightened and repelled by all\\nshe saw, led on her bewildered charge, clinging close to her conductor,\\nand trembling lest in the press she should be separated from him and\\nleft to find her way alone.', 'Quickening their steps to get clear of all\\nthe roar and riot, they at length passed through the town and made for\\nthe race-course, which was upon an open heath, situated on an eminence,\\na full mile distant from its furthest bounds.', 'Although there were many people here, none of the best favoured or best\\nclad, busily erecting tents and driving stakes in the ground, and\\nhurrying to and fro with dusty feet and many a grumbled oath--although\\nthere were tired children cradled on heaps of straw between the wheels\\nof carts, crying themselves to sleep--and poor lean horses and donkeys\\njust turned loose, grazing among the men and women, and pots and\\nkettles, and half-lighted fires, and ends of candles flaring and\\nwasting in the air--for all this, the child felt it an escape from the\\ntown and drew her breath more freely.', 'After a scanty supper, the\\npurchase of which reduced her little stock so low, that she had only a\\nfew halfpence with which to buy a breakfast on the morrow, she and the\\nold man lay down to rest in a corner of a tent, and slept, despite the\\nbusy preparations that were going on around them all night long.', 'And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread.', 'Soon\\nafter sunrise in the morning she stole out from the tent, and rambling\\ninto some fields at a short distance, plucked a few wild roses and such\\nhumble flowers, purposing to make them into little nosegays and offer\\nthem to the ladies in the carriages when the company arrived.', 'Her\\nthoughts were not idle while she was thus employed; when she returned\\nand was seated beside the old man in one corner of the tent, tying her\\nflowers together, while the two men lay dozing in another corner, she\\nplucked him by the sleeve, and slightly glancing towards them, said, in\\na low voice--\\n\\n‘Grandfather, don’t look at those I talk of, and don’t seem as if I\\nspoke of anything but what I am about.', 'What was that you told me\\nbefore we left the old house?', 'That if they knew what we were going to\\ndo, they would say that you were mad, and part us?’\\n\\nThe old man turned to her with an aspect of wild terror; but she\\nchecked him by a look, and bidding him hold some flowers while she tied\\nthem up, and so bringing her lips closer to his ear, said--\\n\\n‘I know that was what you told me.', 'You needn’t speak, dear.', 'I\\nrecollect it very well.', 'It was not likely that I should forget it.', 'Grandfather, these men suspect that we have secretly left our friends,\\nand mean to carry us before some gentleman and have us taken care of\\nand sent back.', 'If you let your hand tremble so, we can never get away\\nfrom them, but if you’re only quiet now, we shall do so, easily.’\\n\\n‘How?’ muttered the old man.', '‘Dear Nelly, how?', 'They will shut me up\\nin a stone room, dark and cold, and chain me up to the wall, Nell--flog\\nme with whips, and never let me see thee more!’\\n\\n‘You’re trembling again,’ said the child.', '‘Keep close to me all day.', 'Never mind them, don’t look at them, but me.', 'I shall find a time when\\nwe can steal away.', 'When I do, mind you come with me, and do not stop\\nor speak a word.', 'Hush!', 'That’s all.’\\n\\n‘Halloa!', 'what are you up to, my dear?’ said Mr Codlin, raising his\\nhead, and yawning.', 'Then observing that his companion was fast asleep,\\nhe added in an earnest whisper, ‘Codlin’s the friend, remember--not\\nShort.’\\n\\n‘Making some nosegays,’ the child replied; ‘I am going to try and sell\\nsome, these three days of the races.', 'Will you have one--as a present I\\nmean?’\\n\\nMr Codlin would have risen to receive it, but the child hurried towards\\nhim and placed it in his hand.', 'He stuck it in his buttonhole with an\\nair of ineffable complacency for a misanthrope, and leering exultingly\\nat the unconscious Short, muttered, as he laid himself down again, ‘Tom\\nCodlin’s the friend, by G--!’\\n\\nAs the morning wore on, the tents assumed a gayer and more brilliant\\nappearance, and long lines of carriages came rolling softly on the\\nturf.', 'Men who had lounged about all night in smock-frocks and leather\\nleggings, came out in silken vests and hats and plumes, as jugglers or\\nmountebanks; or in gorgeous liveries as soft-spoken servants at\\ngambling booths; or in sturdy yeoman dress as decoys at unlawful games.', 'Black-eyed gipsy girls, hooded in showy handkerchiefs, sallied forth to\\ntell fortunes, and pale slender women with consumptive faces lingered\\nupon the footsteps of ventriloquists and conjurors, and counted the\\nsixpences with anxious eyes long before they were gained.', 'As many of\\nthe children as could be kept within bounds, were stowed away, with all\\nthe other signs of dirt and poverty, among the donkeys, carts, and\\nhorses; and as many as could not be thus disposed of ran in and out in\\nall intricate spots, crept between people’s legs and carriage wheels,\\nand came forth unharmed from under horses’ hoofs.', 'The dancing-dogs,\\nthe stilts, the little lady and the tall man, and all the other\\nattractions, with organs out of number and bands innumerable, emerged\\nfrom the holes and corners in which they had passed the night, and\\nflourished boldly in the sun.', 'Along the uncleared course, Short led his party, sounding the brazen\\ntrumpet and revelling in the voice of Punch; and at his heels went\\nThomas Codlin, bearing the show as usual, and keeping his eye on Nelly\\nand her grandfather, as they rather lingered in the rear.', 'The child\\nbore upon her arm the little basket with her flowers, and sometimes\\nstopped, with timid and modest looks, to offer them at some gay\\ncarriage; but alas!', 'there were many bolder beggars there, gipsies who\\npromised husbands, and other adepts in their trade, and although some\\nladies smiled gently as they shook their heads, and others cried to the\\ngentlemen beside them ‘See, what a pretty face!’ they let the pretty\\nface pass on, and never thought that it looked tired or hungry.', 'There was but one lady who seemed to understand the child, and she was\\none who sat alone in a handsome carriage, while two young men in\\ndashing clothes, who had just dismounted from it, talked and laughed\\nloudly at a little distance, appearing to forget her, quite.', 'There\\nwere many ladies all around, but they turned their backs, or looked\\nanother way, or at the two young men (not unfavourably at them), and\\nleft her to herself.', 'She motioned away a gipsy-woman urgent to tell\\nher fortune, saying that it was told already and had been for some\\nyears, but called the child towards her, and taking her flowers put\\nmoney into her trembling hand, and bade her go home and keep at home\\nfor God’s sake.', 'Many a time they went up and down those long, long lines, seeing\\neverything but the horses and the race; when the bell rang to clear the\\ncourse, going back to rest among the carts and donkeys, and not coming\\nout again until the heat was over.', 'Many a time, too, was Punch\\ndisplayed in the full zenith of his humour, but all this while the eye\\nof Thomas Codlin was upon them, and to escape without notice was\\nimpracticable.', 'At length, late in the day, Mr Codlin pitched the show in a convenient\\nspot, and the spectators were soon in the very triumph of the scene.', 'The child, sitting down with the old man close behind it, had been\\nthinking how strange it was that horses who were such fine honest\\ncreatures should seem to make vagabonds of all the men they drew about\\nthem, when a loud laugh at some extemporaneous witticism of Mr Short’s,\\nhaving allusion to the circumstances of the day, roused her from her\\nmeditation and caused her to look around.', 'If they were ever to get away unseen, that was the very moment.', 'Short\\nwas plying the quarter-staves vigorously and knocking the characters in\\nthe fury of the combat against the sides of the show, the people were\\nlooking on with laughing faces, and Mr Codlin had relaxed into a grim\\nsmile as his roving eye detected hands going into waistcoat pockets and\\ngroping secretly for sixpences.', 'If they were ever to get away unseen,\\nthat was the very moment.', 'They seized it, and fled.', 'They made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people,\\nand never once stopped to look behind.', 'The bell was ringing and the\\ncourse was cleared by the time they reached the ropes, but they dashed\\nacross it insensible to the shouts and screeching that assailed them\\nfor breaking in upon its sanctity, and creeping under the brow of the\\nhill at a quick pace, made for the open fields.', 'CHAPTER 20\\n\\nDay after day as he bent his steps homeward, returning from some new\\neffort to procure employment, Kit raised his eyes to the window of the\\nlittle room he had so much commended to the child, and hoped to see\\nsome indication of her presence.', 'His own earnest wish, coupled with\\nthe assurance he had received from Quilp, filled him with the belief\\nthat she would yet arrive to claim the humble shelter he had offered,\\nand from the death of each day’s hope another hope sprung up to live\\nto-morrow.', '‘I think they must certainly come to-morrow, eh mother?’ said Kit,\\nlaying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke.', '‘They\\nhave been gone a week.', 'They surely couldn’t stop away more than a\\nweek, could they now?’\\n\\nThe mother shook her head, and reminded him how often he had been\\ndisappointed already.', '‘For the matter of that,’ said Kit, ‘you speak true and sensible\\nenough, as you always do, mother.', 'Still, I do consider that a week is\\nquite long enough for ‘em to be rambling about; don’t you say so?’\\n\\n‘Quite long enough, Kit, longer than enough, but they may not come back\\nfor all that.’\\n\\nKit was for a moment disposed to be vexed by this contradiction, and\\nnot the less so from having anticipated it in his own mind and knowing\\nhow just it was.', 'But the impulse was only momentary, and the vexed\\nlook became a kind one before it had crossed the room.', '‘Then what do you think, mother, has become of ‘em?', 'You don’t think\\nthey’ve gone to sea, anyhow?’\\n\\n‘Not gone for sailors, certainly,’ returned the mother with a smile.', '‘But I can’t help thinking that they have gone to some foreign country.’\\n\\n‘I say,’ cried Kit with a rueful face, ‘don’t talk like that, mother.’\\n\\n‘I am afraid they have, and that’s the truth,’ she said.', '‘It’s the\\ntalk of all the neighbours, and there are some even that know of their\\nhaving been seen on board ship, and can tell you the name of the place\\nthey’ve gone to, which is more than I can, my dear, for it’s a very\\nhard one.’\\n\\n‘I don’t believe it,’ said Kit.', '‘Not a word of it.', 'A set of idle\\nchatterboxes, how should they know!’\\n\\n‘They may be wrong of course,’ returned the mother, ‘I can’t tell about\\nthat, though I don’t think it’s at all unlikely that they’re in the\\nright, for the talk is that the old gentleman had put by a little money\\nthat nobody knew of, not even that ugly little man you talk to me\\nabout--what’s his name--Quilp; and that he and Miss Nell have gone to\\nlive abroad where it can’t be taken from them, and they will never be\\ndisturbed.', 'That don’t seem very far out of the way now, do it?’\\n\\nKit scratched his head mournfully, in reluctant admission that it did\\nnot, and clambering up to the old nail took down the cage and set\\nhimself to clean it and to feed the bird.', 'His thoughts reverting from\\nthis occupation to the little old gentleman who had given him the\\nshilling, he suddenly recollected that that was the very day--nay,\\nnearly the very hour--at which the little old gentleman had said he\\nshould be at the Notary’s house again.', 'He no sooner remembered this,\\nthan he hung up the cage with great precipitation, and hastily\\nexplaining the nature of his errand, went off at full speed to the\\nappointed place.', 'It was some two minutes after the time when he reached the spot, which\\nwas a considerable distance from his home, but by great good luck the\\nlittle old gentleman had not yet arrived; at least there was no\\npony-chaise to be seen, and it was not likely that he had come and gone\\nagain in so short a space.', 'Greatly relieved to find that he was not\\ntoo late, Kit leant against a lamp-post to take breath, and waited the\\nadvent of the pony and his charge.', 'Sure enough, before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the\\nstreet, looking as obstinate as pony might, and picking his steps as if\\nhe were spying about for the cleanest places, and would by no means\\ndirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently.', 'Behind the pony sat\\nthe little old gentleman, and by the old gentleman’s side sat the\\nlittle old lady, carrying just such a nosegay as she had brought before.', 'The old gentleman, the old lady, the pony, and the chaise, came up the\\nstreet in perfect unanimity, until they arrived within some half a\\ndozen doors of the Notary’s house, when the pony, deceived by a\\nbrass-plate beneath a tailor’s knocker, came to a halt, and maintained\\nby a sturdy silence, that that was the house they wanted.', '‘Now, Sir, will you ha’ the goodness to go on; this is not the place,’\\nsaid the old gentleman.', 'The pony looked with great attention into a fire-plug which was near\\nhim, and appeared to be quite absorbed in contemplating it.', '‘Oh dear, such a naughty Whisker!’ cried the old lady.', '‘After being so\\ngood too, and coming along so well!', 'I am quite ashamed of him.', 'I\\ndon’t know what we are to do with him, I really don’t.’\\n\\nThe pony having thoroughly satisfied himself as to the nature and\\nproperties of the fire-plug, looked into the air after his old enemies\\nthe flies, and as there happened to be one of them tickling his ear at\\nthat moment he shook his head and whisked his tail, after which he\\nappeared full of thought but quite comfortable and collected.', 'The old\\ngentleman having exhausted his powers of persuasion, alighted to lead\\nhim; whereupon the pony, perhaps because he held this to be a\\nsufficient concession, perhaps because he happened to catch sight of\\nthe other brass-plate, or perhaps because he was in a spiteful humour,\\ndarted off with the old lady and stopped at the right house, leaving\\nthe old gentleman to come panting on behind.', 'It was then that Kit presented himself at the pony’s head, and touched\\nhis hat with a smile.', '‘Why, bless me,’ cried the old gentleman, ‘the lad is here!', 'My dear,\\ndo you see?’\\n\\n‘I said I’d be here, Sir,’ said Kit, patting Whisker’s neck.', '‘I hope\\nyou’ve had a pleasant ride, sir.', 'He’s a very nice little pony.’\\n\\n‘My dear,’ said the old gentleman.', '‘This is an uncommon lad; a good\\nlad, I’m sure.’\\n\\n‘I’m sure he is,’ rejoined the old lady.', '‘A very good lad, and I am\\nsure he is a good son.’\\n\\nKit acknowledged these expressions of confidence by touching his hat\\nagain and blushing very much.', 'The old gentleman then handed the old\\nlady out, and after looking at him with an approving smile, they went\\ninto the house--talking about him as they went, Kit could not help\\nfeeling.', 'Presently Mr Witherden, smelling very hard at the nosegay,\\ncame to the window and looked at him, and after that Mr Abel came and\\nlooked at him, and after that the old gentleman and lady came and\\nlooked at him again, and after that they all came and looked at him\\ntogether, which Kit, feeling very much embarrassed by, made a pretence\\nof not observing.', 'Therefore he patted the pony more and more; and this\\nliberty the pony most handsomely permitted.', 'The faces had not disappeared from the window many moments, when Mr\\nChuckster in his official coat, and with his hat hanging on his head\\njust as it happened to fall from its peg, appeared upon the pavement,\\nand telling him he was wanted inside, bade him go in and he would mind\\nthe chaise the while.', 'In giving him this direction Mr Chuckster\\nremarked that he wished that he might be blessed if he could make out\\nwhether he (Kit) was ‘precious raw’ or ‘precious deep,’ but intimated\\nby a distrustful shake of the head, that he inclined to the latter\\nopinion.', 'Kit entered the office in a great tremor, for he was not used to going\\namong strange ladies and gentlemen, and the tin boxes and bundles of\\ndusty papers had in his eyes an awful and venerable air.', 'Mr Witherden\\ntoo was a bustling gentleman who talked loud and fast, and all eyes\\nwere upon him, and he was very shabby.', '‘Well, boy,’ said Mr Witherden, ‘you came to work out that\\nshilling;--not to get another, hey?’\\n\\n‘No indeed, sir,’ replied Kit, taking courage to look up.', '‘I never\\nthought of such a thing.’\\n\\n‘Father alive?’ said the Notary.', '‘Dead, sir.’\\n\\n‘Mother?’\\n\\n‘Yes, sir.’\\n\\n‘Married again--eh?’\\n\\nKit made answer, not without some indignation, that she was a widow\\nwith three children, and that as to her marrying again, if the\\ngentleman knew her he wouldn’t think of such a thing.', 'At this reply Mr\\nWitherden buried his nose in the flowers again, and whispered behind\\nthe nosegay to the old gentleman that he believed the lad was as honest\\na lad as need be.', '‘Now,’ said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of\\nhim, ‘I am not going to give you anything--’\\n\\n‘Thank you, sir,’ Kit replied; and quite seriously too, for this\\nannouncement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the Notary had\\nhinted.', '‘--But,’ resumed the old gentleman, ‘perhaps I may want to know\\nsomething more about you, so tell me where you live, and I’ll put it\\ndown in my pocket-book.’\\n\\nKit told him, and the old gentleman wrote down the address with his\\npencil.', 'He had scarcely done so, when there was a great uproar in the\\nstreet, and the old lady hurrying to the window cried that Whisker had\\nrun away, upon which Kit darted out to the rescue, and the others\\nfollowed.', 'It seemed that Mr Chuckster had been standing with his hands in his\\npockets looking carelessly at the pony, and occasionally insulting him\\nwith such admonitions as ‘Stand still,’--‘Be quiet,’--‘Woa-a-a,’ and the\\nlike, which by a pony of spirit cannot be borne.', 'Consequently, the\\npony being deterred by no considerations of duty or obedience, and not\\nhaving before him the slightest fear of the human eye, had at length\\nstarted off, and was at that moment rattling down the street--Mr\\nChuckster, with his hat off and a pen behind his ear, hanging on in the\\nrear of the chaise and making futile attempts to draw it the other way,\\nto the unspeakable admiration of all beholders.', 'Even in running away,\\nhowever, Whisker was perverse, for he had not gone very far when he\\nsuddenly stopped, and before assistance could be rendered, commenced\\nbacking at nearly as quick a pace as he had gone forward.', 'By these\\nmeans Mr Chuckster was pushed and hustled to the office again, in a\\nmost inglorious manner, and arrived in a state of great exhaustion and\\ndiscomfiture.', 'The old lady then stepped into her seat, and Mr Abel (whom they had\\ncome to fetch) into his.', 'The old gentleman, after reasoning with the\\npony on the extreme impropriety of his conduct, and making the best\\namends in his power to Mr Chuckster, took his place also, and they\\ndrove away, waving a farewell to the Notary and his clerk, and more\\nthan once turning to nod kindly to Kit as he watched them from the road.', 'CHAPTER 21\\n\\nKit turned away and very soon forgot the pony, and the chaise, and the\\nlittle old lady, and the little old gentleman, and the little young\\ngentleman to boot, in thinking what could have become of his late\\nmaster and his lovely grandchild, who were the fountain-head of all his\\nmeditations.', 'Still casting about for some plausible means of\\naccounting for their non-appearance, and of persuading himself that\\nthey must soon return, he bent his steps towards home, intending to\\nfinish the task which the sudden recollection of his contract had\\ninterrupted, and then to sally forth once more to seek his fortune for\\nthe day.', 'When he came to the corner of the court in which he lived, lo and\\nbehold there was the pony again!', 'Yes, there he was, looking more\\nobstinate than ever; and alone in the chaise, keeping a steady watch\\nupon his every wink, sat Mr Abel, who, lifting up his eyes by chance\\nand seeing Kit pass by, nodded to him as though he would have nodded\\nhis head off.', 'Kit wondered to see the pony again, so near his own home too, but it\\nnever occurred to him for what purpose the pony might have come there,\\nor where the old lady and the old gentleman had gone, until he lifted\\nthe latch of the door, and walking in, found them seated in the room in\\nconversation with his mother, at which unexpected sight he pulled off\\nhis hat and made his best bow in some confusion.', '‘We are here before you, you see, Christopher,’ said Mr Garland smiling.', '‘Yes, sir,’ said Kit; and as he said it, he looked towards his mother\\nfor an explanation of the visit.', '‘The gentleman’s been kind enough, my dear,’ said she, in reply to this\\nmute interrogation, ‘to ask me whether you were in a good place, or in\\nany place at all, and when I told him no, you were not in any, he was\\nso good as to say that--’\\n\\n‘--That we wanted a good lad in our house,’ said the old gentleman and\\nthe old lady both together, ‘and that perhaps we might think of it, if\\nwe found everything as we would wish it to be.’\\n\\nAs this thinking of it, plainly meant the thinking of engaging Kit, he\\nimmediately partook of his mother’s anxiety and fell into a great\\nflutter; for the little old couple were very methodical and cautious,\\nand asked so many questions that he began to be afraid there was no\\nchance of his success.', '‘You see, my good woman,’ said Mrs Garland to Kit’s mother, ‘that it’s\\nnecessary to be very careful and particular in such a matter as this,\\nfor we’re only three in family, and are very quiet regular folks, and\\nit would be a sad thing if we made any kind of mistake, and found\\nthings different from what we hoped and expected.’\\n\\nTo this, Kit’s mother replied, that certainly it was quite true, and\\nquite right, and quite proper, and Heaven forbid that she should\\nshrink, or have cause to shrink, from any inquiry into her character or\\nthat of her son, who was a very good son though she was his mother, in\\nwhich respect, she was bold to say, he took after his father, who was\\nnot only a good son to HIS mother, but the best of husbands and the\\nbest of fathers besides, which Kit could and would corroborate she\\nknew, and so would little Jacob and the baby likewise if they were old\\nenough, which unfortunately they were not, though as they didn’t know\\nwhat a loss they had had, perhaps it was a great deal better that they\\nshould be as young as they were; and so Kit’s mother wound up a long\\nstory by wiping her eyes with her apron, and patting little Jacob’s\\nhead, who was rocking the cradle and staring with all his might at the\\nstrange lady and gentleman.', 'When Kit’s mother had done speaking, the old lady struck in again, and\\nsaid that she was quite sure she was a very honest and very respectable\\nperson or she never would have expressed herself in that manner, and\\nthat certainly the appearance of the children and the cleanliness of\\nthe house deserved great praise and did her the utmost credit, whereat\\nKit’s mother dropped a curtsey and became consoled.', 'Then the good\\nwoman entered in a long and minute account of Kit’s life and history\\nfrom the earliest period down to that time, not omitting to make\\nmention of his miraculous fall out of a back-parlour window when an\\ninfant of tender years, or his uncommon sufferings in a state of\\nmeasles, which were illustrated by correct imitations of the plaintive\\nmanner in which he called for toast and water, day and night, and said,\\n‘don’t cry, mother, I shall soon be better;’ for proof of which\\nstatements reference was made to Mrs Green, lodger, at the\\ncheesemonger’s round the corner, and divers other ladies and gentlemen\\nin various parts of England and Wales (and one Mr Brown who was\\nsupposed to be then a corporal in the East Indies, and who could of\\ncourse be found with very little trouble), within whose personal\\nknowledge the circumstances had occurred.', 'This narration ended, Mr\\nGarland put some questions to Kit respecting his qualifications and\\ngeneral acquirements, while Mrs Garland noticed the children, and\\nhearing from Kit’s mother certain remarkable circumstances which had\\nattended the birth of each, related certain other remarkable\\ncircumstances which had attended the birth of her own son, Mr Abel,\\nfrom which it appeared that both Kit’s mother and herself had been,\\nabove and beyond all other women of what condition or age soever,\\npeculiarly hemmed in with perils and dangers.', 'Lastly, inquiry was made\\ninto the nature and extent of Kit’s wardrobe, and a small advance being\\nmade to improve the same, he was formally hired at an annual income of\\nSix Pounds, over and above his board and lodging, by Mr and Mrs\\nGarland, of Abel Cottage, Finchley.', 'It would be difficult to say which party appeared most pleased with\\nthis arrangement, the conclusion of which was hailed with nothing but\\npleasant looks and cheerful smiles on both sides.', 'It was settled that\\nKit should repair to his new abode on the next day but one, in the\\nmorning; and finally, the little old couple, after bestowing a bright\\nhalf-crown on little Jacob and another on the baby, took their leaves;\\nbeing escorted as far as the street by their new attendant, who held\\nthe obdurate pony by the bridle while they took their seats, and saw\\nthem drive away with a lightened heart.', '‘Well, mother,’ said Kit, hurrying back into the house, ‘I think my\\nfortune’s about made now.’\\n\\n‘I should think it was indeed, Kit,’ rejoined his mother.', '‘Six pound a\\nyear!', 'Only think!’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ said Kit, trying to maintain the gravity which the consideration\\nof such a sum demanded, but grinning with delight in spite of himself.', '‘There’s a property!’\\n\\nKit drew a long breath when he had said this, and putting his hands\\ndeep into his pockets as if there were one year’s wages at least in\\neach, looked at his mother, as though he saw through her, and down an\\nimmense perspective of sovereigns beyond.', '‘Please God we’ll make such a lady of you for Sundays, mother!', 'such a\\nscholar of Jacob, such a child of the baby, such a room of the one up\\nstairs!', 'Six pound a year!’\\n\\n‘Hem!’ croaked a strange voice.', '‘What’s that about six pound a year?', 'What about six pound a year?’  And as the voice made this inquiry,\\nDaniel Quilp walked in with Richard Swiveller at his heels.', '‘Who said he was to have six pound a year?’ said Quilp, looking sharply\\nround.', '‘Did the old man say it, or did little Nell say it?', 'And what’s\\nhe to have it for, and where are they, eh!’\\n\\nThe good woman was so much alarmed by the sudden apparition of this\\nunknown piece of ugliness, that she hastily caught the baby from its\\ncradle and retreated into the furthest corner of the room; while little\\nJacob, sitting upon his stool with his hands on his knees, looked full\\nat him in a species of fascination, roaring lustily all the time.', 'Richard Swiveller took an easy observation of the family over Mr Quilp’s\\nhead, and Quilp himself, with his hands in his pockets, smiled in an\\nexquisite enjoyment of the commotion he occasioned.', '‘Don’t be frightened, mistress,’ said Quilp, after a pause.', '‘Your son\\nknows me; I don’t eat babies; I don’t like ‘em.', 'It will be as well to\\nstop that young screamer though, in case I should be tempted to do him\\na mischief.', 'Holloa, sir!', 'Will you be quiet?’\\n\\nLittle Jacob stemmed the course of two tears which he was squeezing out\\nof his eyes, and instantly subsided into a silent horror.', '‘Mind you don’t break out again, you villain,’ said Quilp, looking\\nsternly at him, ‘or I’ll make faces at you and throw you into fits, I\\nwill.', 'Now you sir, why haven’t you been to me as you promised?’\\n\\n‘What should I come for?’ retorted Kit.', '‘I hadn’t any business with\\nyou, no more than you had with me.’\\n\\n‘Here, mistress,’ said Quilp, turning quickly away, and appealing from\\nKit to his mother.', '‘When did his old master come or send here last?', 'Is he here now?', 'If not, where’s he gone?’\\n\\n‘He has not been here at all,’ she replied.', '‘I wish we knew where they\\nhave gone, for it would make my son a good deal easier in his mind, and\\nme too.', 'If you’re the gentleman named Mr Quilp, I should have thought\\nyou’d have known, and so I told him only this very day.’\\n\\n‘Humph!’ muttered Quilp, evidently disappointed to believe that this\\nwas true.', '‘That’s what you tell this gentleman too, is it?’\\n\\n‘If the gentleman comes to ask the same question, I can’t tell him\\nanything else, sir; and I only wish I could, for our own sakes,’ was\\nthe reply.', 'Quilp glanced at Richard Swiveller, and observed that having met him on\\nthe threshold, he assumed that he had come in search of some\\nintelligence of the fugitives.', 'He supposed he was right?', '‘Yes,’ said Dick, ‘that was the object of the present expedition.', 'I\\nfancied it possible--but let us go ring fancy’s knell.', 'I’ll begin it.’\\n\\n‘You seem disappointed,’ observed Quilp.', '‘A baffler, Sir, a baffler, that’s all,’ returned Dick.', '‘I have\\nentered upon a speculation which has proved a baffler; and a Being of\\nbrightness and beauty will be offered up a sacrifice at Cheggs’s altar.', 'That’s all, sir.’\\n\\nThe dwarf eyed Richard with a sarcastic smile, but Richard, who had\\nbeen taking a rather strong lunch with a friend, observed him not, and\\ncontinued to deplore his fate with mournful and despondent looks.', 'Quilp plainly discerned that there was some secret reason for this\\nvisit and his uncommon disappointment, and, in the hope that there\\nmight be means of mischief lurking beneath it, resolved to worm it out.', 'He had no sooner adopted this resolution, than he conveyed as much\\nhonesty into his face as it was capable of expressing, and sympathised\\nwith Mr Swiveller exceedingly.', '‘I am disappointed myself,’ said Quilp, ‘out of mere friendly feeling\\nfor them; but you have real reasons, private reasons I have no doubt,\\nfor your disappointment, and therefore it comes heavier than mine.’\\n\\n‘Why, of course it does,’ Dick observed, testily.', '‘Upon my word, I’m very sorry, very sorry.', 'I’m rather cast down\\nmyself.', 'As we are companions in adversity, shall we be companions in\\nthe surest way of forgetting it?', 'If you had no particular business,\\nnow, to lead you in another direction,’ urged Quilp, plucking him by\\nthe sleeve and looking slyly up into his face out of the corners of his\\neyes, ‘there is a house by the water-side where they have some of the\\nnoblest Schiedam--reputed to be smuggled, but that’s between\\nourselves--that can be got in all the world.', 'The landlord knows me.', 'There’s a little summer-house overlooking the river, where we might\\ntake a glass of this delicious liquor with a whiff of the best\\ntobacco--it’s in this case, and of the rarest quality, to my certain\\nknowledge--and be perfectly snug and happy, could we possibly contrive\\nit; or is there any very particular engagement that peremptorily takes\\nyou another way, Mr Swiveller, eh?’\\n\\nAs the dwarf spoke, Dick’s face relaxed into a compliant smile, and his\\nbrows slowly unbent.', 'By the time he had finished, Dick was looking\\ndown at Quilp in the same sly manner as Quilp was looking up at him,\\nand there remained nothing more to be done but to set out for the house\\nin question.', 'This they did, straightway.', 'The moment their backs were\\nturned, little Jacob thawed, and resumed his crying from the point\\nwhere Quilp had frozen him.', 'The summer-house of which Mr Quilp had spoken was a rugged wooden box,\\nrotten and bare to see, which overhung the river’s mud, and threatened\\nto slide down into it.', 'The tavern to which it belonged was a crazy\\nbuilding, sapped and undermined by the rats, and only upheld by great\\nbars of wood which were reared against its walls, and had propped it up\\nso long that even they were decaying and yielding with their load, and\\nof a windy night might be heard to creak and crack as if the whole\\nfabric were about to come toppling down.', 'The house stood--if anything\\nso old and feeble could be said to stand--on a piece of waste ground,\\nblighted with the unwholesome smoke of factory chimneys, and echoing\\nthe clank of iron wheels and rush of troubled water.', 'Its internal\\naccommodations amply fulfilled the promise of the outside.', 'The rooms\\nwere low and damp, the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes,\\nthe rotten floors had sunk from their level, the very beams started\\nfrom their places and warned the timid stranger from their\\nneighbourhood.', 'To this inviting spot, entreating him to observe its beauties as they\\npassed along, Mr Quilp led Richard Swiveller, and on the table of the\\nsummer-house, scored deep with many a gallows and initial letter, there\\nsoon appeared a wooden keg, full of the vaunted liquor.', 'Drawing it off\\ninto the glasses with the skill of a practised hand, and mixing it with\\nabout a third part of water, Mr Quilp assigned to Richard Swiveller his\\nportion, and lighting his pipe from an end of a candle in a very old\\nand battered lantern, drew himself together upon a seat and puffed away.', '‘Is it good?’ said Quilp, as Richard Swiveller smacked his lips, ‘is it\\nstrong and fiery?', 'Does it make you wink, and choke, and your eyes\\nwater, and your breath come short--does it?’\\n\\n‘Does it?’ cried Dick, throwing away part of the contents of his glass,\\nand filling it up with water, ‘why, man, you don’t mean to tell me that\\nyou drink such fire as this?’\\n\\n‘No!’ rejoined Quilp, ‘Not drink it!', 'Look here.', 'And here.', 'And here\\nagain.', 'Not drink it!’\\n\\nAs he spoke, Daniel Quilp drew off and drank three small glassfuls of\\nthe raw spirit, and then with a horrible grimace took a great many\\npulls at his pipe, and swallowing the smoke, discharged it in a heavy\\ncloud from his nose.', 'This feat accomplished he drew himself together\\nin his former position, and laughed excessively.', '‘Give us a toast!’ cried Quilp, rattling on the table in a dexterous\\nmanner with his fist and elbow alternately, in a kind of tune, ‘a\\nwoman, a beauty.', 'Let’s have a beauty for our toast and empty our\\nglasses to the last drop.', 'Her name, come!’\\n\\n‘If you want a name,’ said Dick, ‘here’s Sophy Wackles.’\\n\\n‘Sophy Wackles,’ screamed the dwarf, ‘Miss Sophy Wackles that is--Mrs\\nRichard Swiveller that shall be--that shall be--ha ha ha!’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ said Dick, ‘you might have said that a few weeks ago, but it\\nwon’t do now, my buck.', 'Immolating herself upon the shrine of Cheggs--’\\n\\n‘Poison Cheggs, cut Cheggs’s ears off,’ rejoined Quilp.', '‘I won’t hear\\nof Cheggs.', 'Her name is Swiveller or nothing.', 'I’ll drink her health\\nagain, and her father’s, and her mother’s; and to all her sisters and\\nbrothers--the glorious family of the Wackleses--all the Wackleses in\\none glass--down with it to the dregs!’\\n\\n‘Well,’ said Richard Swiveller, stopping short in the act of raising\\nthe glass to his lips and looking at the dwarf in a species of stupor\\nas he flourished his arms and legs about: ‘you’re a jolly fellow, but\\nof all the jolly fellows I ever saw or heard of, you have the queerest\\nand most extraordinary way with you, upon my life you have.’\\n\\nThis candid declaration tended rather to increase than restrain Mr\\nQuilp’s eccentricities, and Richard Swiveller, astonished to see him in\\nsuch a roystering vein, and drinking not a little himself, for\\ncompany--began imperceptibly to become more companionable and\\nconfiding, so that, being judiciously led on by Mr Quilp, he grew at\\nlast very confiding indeed.', 'Having once got him into this mood, and\\nknowing now the key-note to strike whenever he was at a loss, Daniel\\nQuilp’s task was comparatively an easy one, and he was soon in\\npossession of the whole details of the scheme contrived between the\\neasy Dick and his more designing friend.', '‘Stop!’ said Quilp.', '‘That’s the thing, that’s the thing.', 'It can be\\nbrought about, it shall be brought about.', 'There’s my hand upon it; I\\nam your friend from this minute.’\\n\\n‘What!', 'do you think there’s still a chance?’ inquired Dick, in surprise\\nat this encouragement.', '‘A chance!’ echoed the dwarf, ‘a certainty!', 'Sophy Wackles may become a\\nCheggs or anything else she likes, but not a Swiveller.', 'Oh you lucky\\ndog!', 'He’s richer than any Jew alive; you’re a made man.', 'I see in you\\nnow nothing but Nelly’s husband, rolling in gold and silver.', 'I’ll help\\nyou.', 'It shall be done.', 'Mind my words, it shall be done.’\\n\\n‘But how?’ said Dick.', '‘There’s plenty of time,’ rejoined the dwarf, ‘and it shall be done.', 'We’ll sit down and talk it over again all the way through.', 'Fill your\\nglass while I’m gone.', 'I shall be back directly--directly.’\\n\\nWith these hasty words, Daniel Quilp withdrew into a dismantled skittle-\\nground behind the public-house, and, throwing himself upon the ground\\nactually screamed and rolled about in uncontrollable delight.', '‘Here’s sport!’ he cried, ‘sport ready to my hand, all invented and\\narranged, and only to be enjoyed.', 'It was this shallow-pated fellow who\\nmade my bones ache t’other day, was it?', 'It was his friend and\\nfellow-plotter, Mr Trent, that once made eyes at Mrs Quilp, and leered\\nand looked, was it?', 'After labouring for two or three years in their\\nprecious scheme, to find that they’ve got a beggar at last, and one of\\nthem tied for life.', 'Ha ha ha!', 'He shall marry Nell.', 'He shall have\\nher, and I’ll be the first man, when the knot’s tied hard and fast, to\\ntell ‘em what they’ve gained and what I’ve helped ‘em to.', 'Here will be\\na clearing of old scores, here will be a time to remind ‘em what a\\ncapital friend I was, and how I helped them to the heiress.', 'Ha ha ha!’\\n\\nIn the height of his ecstasy, Mr Quilp had like to have met with a\\ndisagreeable check, for rolling very near a broken dog-kennel, there\\nleapt forth a large fierce dog, who, but that his chain was of the\\nshortest, would have given him a disagreeable salute.', 'As it was, the\\ndwarf remained upon his back in perfect safety, taunting the dog with\\nhideous faces, and triumphing over him in his inability to advance\\nanother inch, though there were not a couple of feet between them.', '‘Why don’t you come and bite me, why don’t you come and tear me to\\npieces, you coward?’ said Quilp, hissing and worrying the animal till\\nhe was nearly mad.', '‘You’re afraid, you bully, you’re afraid, you know\\nyou are.’\\n\\nThe dog tore and strained at his chain with starting eyes and furious\\nbark, but there the dwarf lay, snapping his fingers with gestures of\\ndefiance and contempt.', 'When he had sufficiently recovered from his\\ndelight, he rose, and with his arms a-kimbo, achieved a kind of\\ndemon-dance round the kennel, just without the limits of the chain,\\ndriving the dog quite wild.', 'Having by this means composed his spirits\\nand put himself in a pleasant train, he returned to his unsuspicious\\ncompanion, whom he found looking at the tide with exceeding gravity,\\nand thinking of that same gold and silver which Mr Quilp had mentioned.', 'CHAPTER 22\\n\\nThe remainder of that day and the whole of the next were a busy time\\nfor the Nubbles family, to whom everything connected with Kit’s outfit\\nand departure was matter of as great moment as if he had been about to\\npenetrate into the interior of Africa, or to take a cruise round the\\nworld.', 'It would be difficult to suppose that there ever was a box\\nwhich was opened and shut so many times within four-and-twenty hours,\\nas that which contained his wardrobe and necessaries; and certainly\\nthere never was one which to two small eyes presented such a mine of\\nclothing, as this mighty chest with its three shirts and proportionate\\nallowance of stockings and pocket-handkerchiefs, disclosed to the\\nastonished vision of little Jacob.', 'At last it was conveyed to the\\ncarrier’s, at whose house at Finchley Kit was to find it next day; and\\nthe box being gone, there remained but two questions for consideration:\\nfirstly, whether the carrier would lose, or dishonestly feign to lose,\\nthe box upon the road; secondly, whether Kit’s mother perfectly\\nunderstood how to take care of herself in the absence of her son.', '‘I don’t think there’s hardly a chance of his really losing it, but\\ncarriers are under great temptation to pretend they lose things, no\\ndoubt,’ said Mrs Nubbles apprehensively, in reference to the first\\npoint.', '‘No doubt about it,’ returned Kit, with a serious look; ‘upon my word,\\nmother, I don’t think it was right to trust it to itself.', 'Somebody\\nought to have gone with it, I’m afraid.’\\n\\n‘We can’t help it now,’ said his mother; ‘but it was foolish and wrong.', 'People oughtn’t to be tempted.’\\n\\nKit inwardly resolved that he would never tempt a carrier any more,\\nsave with an empty box; and having formed this Christian determination,\\nhe turned his thoughts to the second question.', '‘_You_ know you must keep up your spirits, mother, and not be lonesome\\nbecause I’m not at home.', 'I shall very often be able to look in when I\\ncome into town I dare say, and I shall send you a letter sometimes, and\\nwhen the quarter comes round, I can get a holiday of course; and then\\nsee if we don’t take little Jacob to the play, and let him know what\\noysters means.’\\n\\n‘I hope plays mayn’t be sinful, Kit, but I’m a’most afraid,’ said Mrs\\nNubbles.', '‘I know who has been putting that in your head,’ rejoined her son\\ndisconsolately; ‘that’s Little Bethel again.', 'Now I say, mother, pray\\ndon’t take to going there regularly, for if I was to see your\\ngood-humoured face that has always made home cheerful, turned into a\\ngrievous one, and the baby trained to look grievous too, and to call\\nitself a young sinner (bless its heart) and a child of the devil (which\\nis calling its dead father names); if I was to see this, and see little\\nJacob looking grievous likewise, I should so take it to heart that I’m\\nsure I should go and list for a soldier, and run my head on purpose\\nagainst the first cannon-ball I saw coming my way.’\\n\\n‘Oh, Kit, don’t talk like that.’\\n\\n‘I would, indeed, mother, and unless you want to make me feel very\\nwretched and uncomfortable, you’ll keep that bow on your bonnet, which\\nyou’d more than half a mind to pull off last week.', 'Can you suppose\\nthere’s any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our\\npoor circumstances will permit?', 'Do I see anything in the way I’m made,\\nwhich calls upon me to be a snivelling, solemn, whispering chap,\\nsneaking about as if I couldn’t help it, and expressing myself in a\\nmost unpleasant snuffle?', 'on the contrary, don’t I see every reason why\\nI shouldn’t?', 'just hear this!', 'Ha ha ha!', 'An’t that as nat’ral as\\nwalking, and as good for the health?', 'Ha ha ha!', 'An’t that as nat’ral\\nas a sheep’s bleating, or a pig’s grunting, or a horse’s neighing, or a\\nbird’s singing?', 'Ha ha ha!', 'Isn’t it, mother?’\\n\\nThere was something contagious in Kit’s laugh, for his mother, who had\\nlooked grave before, first subsided into a smile, and then fell to\\njoining in it heartily, which occasioned Kit to say that he knew it was\\nnatural, and to laugh the more.', 'Kit and his mother, laughing together\\nin a pretty loud key, woke the baby, who, finding that there was\\nsomething very jovial and agreeable in progress, was no sooner in its\\nmother’s arms than it began to kick and laugh, most vigorously.', 'This\\nnew illustration of his argument so tickled Kit, that he fell backward\\nin his chair in a state of exhaustion, pointing at the baby and shaking\\nhis sides till he rocked again.', 'After recovering twice or thrice, and\\nas often relapsing, he wiped his eyes and said grace; and a very\\ncheerful meal their scanty supper was.', 'With more kisses, and hugs, and tears, than many young gentlemen who\\nstart upon their travels, and leave well-stocked homes behind them,\\nwould deem within the bounds of probability (if matter so low could be\\nherein set down), Kit left the house at an early hour next morning, and\\nset out to walk to Finchley; feeling a sufficient pride in his\\nappearance to have warranted his excommunication from Little Bethel\\nfrom that time forth, if he had ever been one of that mournful\\ncongregation.', 'Lest anybody should feel a curiosity to know how Kit was clad, it may\\nbe briefly remarked that he wore no livery, but was dressed in a coat\\nof pepper-and-salt with waistcoat of canary colour, and nether garments\\nof iron-grey; besides these glories, he shone in the lustre of a new\\npair of boots and an extremely stiff and shiny hat, which on being\\nstruck anywhere with the knuckles, sounded like a drum.', 'And in this\\nattire, rather wondering that he attracted so little attention, and\\nattributing the circumstance to the insensibility of those who got up\\nearly, he made his way towards Abel Cottage.', 'Without encountering any more remarkable adventure on the road, than\\nmeeting a lad in a brimless hat, the exact counterpart of his old one,\\non whom he bestowed half the sixpence he possessed, Kit arrived in\\ncourse of time at the carrier’s house, where, to the lasting honour of\\nhuman nature, he found the box in safety.', 'Receiving from the wife of\\nthis immaculate man, a direction to Mr Garland’s, he took the box upon\\nhis shoulder and repaired thither directly.', 'To be sure, it was a beautiful little cottage with a thatched roof and\\nlittle spires at the gable-ends, and pieces of stained glass in some of\\nthe windows, almost as large as pocket-books.', 'On one side of the house\\nwas a little stable, just the size for the pony, with a little room\\nover it, just the size for Kit.', 'White curtains were fluttering, and\\nbirds in cages that looked as bright as if they were made of gold, were\\nsinging at the windows; plants were arranged on either side of the\\npath, and clustered about the door; and the garden was bright with\\nflowers in full bloom, which shed a sweet odour all round, and had a\\ncharming and elegant appearance.', 'Everything within the house and\\nwithout, seemed to be the perfection of neatness and order.', 'In the\\ngarden there was not a weed to be seen, and to judge from some dapper\\ngardening-tools, a basket, and a pair of gloves which were lying in one\\nof the walks, old Mr Garland had been at work in it that very morning.', 'Kit looked about him, and admired, and looked again, and this a great\\nmany times before he could make up his mind to turn his head another\\nway and ring the bell.', 'There was abundance of time to look about him\\nagain though, when he had rung it, for nobody came, so after ringing it\\ntwice or thrice he sat down upon his box, and waited.', 'He rang the bell a great many times, and yet nobody came.', 'But at last,\\nas he was sitting upon the box thinking about giants’ castles, and\\nprincesses tied up to pegs by the hair of their heads, and dragons\\nbursting out from behind gates, and other incidents of the like nature,\\ncommon in story-books to youths of low degree on their first visit to\\nstrange houses, the door was gently opened, and a little servant-girl,\\nvery tidy, modest, and demure, but very pretty too, appeared.', '‘I suppose you’re Christopher, sir,’ said the servant-girl.', 'Kit got off the box, and said yes, he was.', '‘I’m afraid you’ve rung a good many times perhaps,’ she rejoined, ‘but\\nwe couldn’t hear you, because we’ve been catching the pony.’\\n\\nKit rather wondered what this meant, but as he couldn’t stop there,\\nasking questions, he shouldered the box again and followed the girl\\ninto the hall, where through a back-door he descried Mr Garland leading\\nWhisker in triumph up the garden, after that self-willed pony had (as\\nhe afterwards learned) dodged the family round a small paddock in the\\nrear, for one hour and three quarters.', 'The old gentleman received him very kindly and so did the old lady,\\nwhose previous good opinion of him was greatly enhanced by his wiping\\nhis boots on the mat until the soles of his feet burnt again.', 'He was\\nthen taken into the parlour to be inspected in his new clothes; and\\nwhen he had been surveyed several times, and had afforded by his\\nappearance unlimited satisfaction, he was taken into the stable (where\\nthe pony received him with uncommon complaisance); and thence into the\\nlittle chamber he had already observed, which was very clean and\\ncomfortable: and thence into the garden, in which the old gentleman\\ntold him he would be taught to employ himself, and where he told him,\\nbesides, what great things he meant to do to make him comfortable, and\\nhappy, if he found he deserved it.', 'All these kindnesses, Kit\\nacknowledged with various expressions of gratitude, and so many touches\\nof the new hat, that the brim suffered considerably.', 'When the old\\ngentleman had said all he had to say in the way of promise and advice,\\nand Kit had said all he had to say in the way of assurance and\\nthankfulness, he was handed over again to the old lady, who, summoning\\nthe little servant-girl (whose name was Barbara) instructed her to take\\nhim down stairs and give him something to eat and drink, after his walk.', 'Down stairs, therefore, Kit went; and at the bottom of the stairs there\\nwas such a kitchen as was never before seen or heard of out of a\\ntoy-shop window, with everything in it as bright and glowing, and as\\nprecisely ordered too, as Barbara herself.', 'And in this kitchen, Kit\\nsat himself down at a table as white as a tablecloth, to eat cold meat,\\nand drink small ale, and use his knife and fork the more awkwardly,\\nbecause there was an unknown Barbara looking on and observing him.', 'It did not appear, however, that there was anything remarkably\\ntremendous about this strange Barbara, who having lived a very quiet\\nlife, blushed very much and was quite as embarrassed and uncertain what\\nshe ought to say or do, as Kit could possibly be.', 'When he had sat for\\nsome little time, attentive to the ticking of the sober clock, he\\nventured to glance curiously at the dresser, and there, among the\\nplates and dishes, were Barbara’s little work-box with a sliding lid to\\nshut in the balls of cotton, and Barbara’s prayer-book, and Barbara’s\\nhymn-book, and Barbara’s Bible.', 'Barbara’s little looking-glass hung in\\na good light near the window, and Barbara’s bonnet was on a nail behind\\nthe door.', 'From all these mute signs and tokens of her presence, he\\nnaturally glanced at Barbara herself, who sat as mute as they, shelling\\npeas into a dish; and just when Kit was looking at her eyelashes and\\nwondering--quite in the simplicity of his heart--what colour her eyes\\nmight be, it perversely happened that Barbara raised her head a little\\nto look at him, when both pair of eyes were hastily withdrawn, and Kit\\nleant over his plate, and Barbara over her pea-shells, each in extreme\\nconfusion at having been detected by the other.', 'CHAPTER 23\\n\\nMr Richard Swiveller wending homeward from the Wilderness (for such was\\nthe appropriate name of Quilp’s choice retreat), after a sinuous and\\ncorkscrew fashion, with many checks and stumbles; after stopping\\nsuddenly and staring about him, then as suddenly running forward for a\\nfew paces, and as suddenly halting again and shaking his head; doing\\neverything with a jerk and nothing by premeditation;--Mr Richard\\nSwiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion, which is\\nconsidered by evil-minded men to be symbolical of intoxication, and is\\nnot held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and\\nreflection in which the actor knows himself to be, began to think that\\npossibly he had misplaced his confidence and that the dwarf might not\\nbe precisely the sort of person to whom to entrust a secret of such\\ndelicacy and importance.', 'And being led and tempted on by this\\nremorseful thought into a condition which the evil-minded class before\\nreferred to would term the maudlin state or stage of drunkenness, it\\noccurred to Mr Swiveller to cast his hat upon the ground, and moan,\\ncrying aloud that he was an unhappy orphan, and that if he had not been\\nan unhappy orphan things had never come to this.', '‘Left an infant by my parents, at an early age,’ said Mr Swiveller,\\nbewailing his hard lot, ‘cast upon the world in my tenderest period,\\nand thrown upon the mercies of a deluding dwarf, who can wonder at my\\nweakness!', 'Here’s a miserable orphan for you.', 'Here,’ said Mr Swiveller\\nraising his voice to a high pitch, and looking sleepily round, ‘is a\\nmiserable orphan!’\\n\\n‘Then,’ said somebody hard by, ‘let me be a father to you.’\\n\\nMr Swiveller swayed himself to and fro to preserve his balance, and,\\nlooking into a kind of haze which seemed to surround him, at last\\nperceived two eyes dimly twinkling through the mist, which he observed\\nafter a short time were in the neighbourhood of a nose and mouth.', 'Casting his eyes down towards that quarter in which, with reference to\\na man’s face, his legs are usually to be found, he observed that the\\nface had a body attached; and when he looked more intently he was\\nsatisfied that the person was Mr Quilp, who indeed had been in his\\ncompany all the time, but whom he had some vague idea of having left a\\nmile or two behind.', '‘You have deceived an orphan, Sir,’ said Mr Swiveller solemnly.’\\n\\n‘I!', 'I’m a second father to you,’ replied Quilp.', '‘You my father, Sir!’ retorted Dick.', '‘Being all right myself, Sir, I\\nrequest to be left alone--instantly, Sir.’\\n\\n‘What a funny fellow you are!’ cried Quilp.', '‘Go, Sir,’ returned Dick, leaning against a post and waving his hand.', '‘Go, deceiver, go, some day, Sir, p’r’aps you’ll waken, from pleasure’s\\ndream to know, the grief of orphans forsaken.', 'Will you go, Sir?’\\n\\nThe dwarf taking no heed of this adjuration, Mr Swiveller advanced with\\nthe view of inflicting upon him condign chastisement.', 'But forgetting\\nhis purpose or changing his mind before he came close to him, he seized\\nhis hand and vowed eternal friendship, declaring with an agreeable\\nfrankness that from that time forth they were brothers in everything\\nbut personal appearance.', 'Then he told his secret over again, with the\\naddition of being pathetic on the subject of Miss Wackles, who, he gave\\nMr Quilp to understand, was the occasion of any slight incoherency he\\nmight observe in his speech at that moment, which was attributable\\nsolely to the strength of his affection and not to rosy wine or other\\nfermented liquor.', 'And then they went on arm-in-arm, very lovingly\\ntogether.', '‘I’m as sharp,’ said Quilp to him, at parting, ‘as sharp as a ferret,\\nand as cunning as a weazel.', 'You bring Trent to me; assure him that I’m\\nhis friend though I fear he a little distrusts me (I don’t know why, I\\nhave not deserved it); and you’ve both of you made your fortunes--in\\nperspective.’\\n\\n‘That’s the worst of it,’ returned Dick.', '‘These fortunes in\\nperspective look such a long way off.’\\n\\n‘But they look smaller than they really are, on that account,’ said\\nQuilp, pressing his arm.', '‘You’ll have no conception of the value of\\nyour prize until you draw close to it.', 'Mark that.’\\n\\n‘D’ye think not?’ said Dick.', '‘Aye, I do; and I am certain of what I say, that’s better,’ returned\\nthe dwarf.', '‘You bring Trent to me.', 'Tell him I am his friend and\\nyours--why shouldn’t I be?’\\n\\n‘There’s no reason why you shouldn’t, certainly,’ replied Dick, ‘and\\nperhaps there are a great many why you should--at least there would be\\nnothing strange in your wanting to be my friend, if you were a choice\\nspirit, but then you know you’re not a choice spirit.’\\n\\n‘I not a choice spirit?’ cried Quilp.', '‘Devil a bit, sir,’ returned Dick.', '‘A man of your appearance couldn’t\\nbe.', 'If you’re any spirit at all, sir, you’re an evil spirit.', 'Choice\\nspirits,’ added Dick, smiting himself on the breast, ‘are quite a\\ndifferent looking sort of people, you may take your oath of that, sir.’\\n\\nQuilp glanced at his free-spoken friend with a mingled expression of\\ncunning and dislike, and wringing his hand almost at the same moment,\\ndeclared that he was an uncommon character and had his warmest esteem.', 'With that they parted; Mr Swiveller to make the best of his way home\\nand sleep himself sober; and Quilp to cogitate upon the discovery he\\nhad made, and exult in the prospect of the rich field of enjoyment and\\nreprisal it opened to him.', 'It was not without great reluctance and misgiving that Mr Swiveller,\\nnext morning, his head racked by the fumes of the renowned Schiedam,\\nrepaired to the lodging of his friend Trent (which was in the roof of\\nan old house in an old ghostly inn), and recounted by very slow degrees\\nwhat had yesterday taken place between him and Quilp.', 'Nor was it\\nwithout great surprise and much speculation on Quilp’s probable\\nmotives, nor without many bitter comments on Dick Swiveller’s folly,\\nthat his friend received the tale.', '‘I don’t defend myself, Fred,’ said the penitent Richard; ‘but the\\nfellow has such a queer way with him and is such an artful dog, that\\nfirst of all he set me upon thinking whether there was any harm in\\ntelling him, and while I was thinking, screwed it out of me.', 'If you\\nhad seen him drink and smoke, as I did, you couldn’t have kept anything\\nfrom him.', 'He’s a Salamander you know, that’s what he is.’\\n\\nWithout inquiring whether Salamanders were of necessity good\\nconfidential agents, or whether a fire-proof man was as a matter of\\ncourse trustworthy, Frederick Trent threw himself into a chair, and,\\nburying his head in his hands, endeavoured to fathom the motives which\\nhad led Quilp to insinuate himself into Richard Swiveller’s\\nconfidence;--for that the disclosure was of his seeking, and had not\\nbeen spontaneously revealed by Dick, was sufficiently plain from\\nQuilp’s seeking his company and enticing him away.', 'The dwarf had twice encountered him when he was endeavouring to obtain\\nintelligence of the fugitives.', 'This, perhaps, as he had not shown any\\nprevious anxiety about them, was enough to awaken suspicion in the\\nbreast of a creature so jealous and distrustful by nature, setting\\naside any additional impulse to curiosity that he might have derived\\nfrom Dick’s incautious manner.', 'But knowing the scheme they had\\nplanned, why should he offer to assist it?', 'This was a question more\\ndifficult of solution; but as knaves generally overreach themselves by\\nimputing their own designs to others, the idea immediately presented\\nitself that some circumstances of irritation between Quilp and the old\\nman, arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected\\nperhaps with his sudden disappearance, now rendered the former desirous\\nof revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of\\nhis love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread\\nand hatred.', 'As Frederick Trent himself, utterly regardless of his\\nsister, had this object at heart, only second to the hope of gain, it\\nseemed to him the more likely to be Quilp’s main principle of action.', 'Once investing the dwarf with a design of his own in abetting them,\\nwhich the attainment of their purpose would serve, it was easy to\\nbelieve him sincere and hearty in the cause; and as there could be no\\ndoubt of his proving a powerful and useful auxiliary, Trent determined\\nto accept his invitation and go to his house that night, and if what he\\nsaid and did confirmed him in the impression he had formed, to let him\\nshare the labour of their plan, but not the profit.', 'Having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this\\nconclusion, he communicated to Mr Swiveller as much of his meditations\\nas he thought proper (Dick would have been perfectly satisfied with\\nless), and giving him the day to recover himself from his late\\nsalamandering, accompanied him at evening to Mr Quilp’s house.', 'Mighty glad Mr Quilp was to see them, or mightily glad he seemed to be;\\nand fearfully polite Mr Quilp was to Mrs Quilp and Mrs Jiniwin; and\\nvery sharp was the look he cast on his wife to observe how she was\\naffected by the recognition of young Trent.', 'Mrs Quilp was as innocent\\nas her own mother of any emotion, painful or pleasant, which the sight\\nof him awakened, but as her husband’s glance made her timid and\\nconfused, and uncertain what to do or what was required of her, Mr\\nQuilp did not fail to assign her embarrassment to the cause he had in\\nhis mind, and while he chuckled at his penetration was secretly\\nexasperated by his jealousy.', 'Nothing of this appeared, however.', 'On the contrary, Mr Quilp was all\\nblandness and suavity, and presided over the case-bottle of rum with\\nextraordinary open-heartedness.', '‘Why, let me see,’ said Quilp.', '‘It must be a matter of nearly two\\nyears since we were first acquainted.’\\n\\n‘Nearer three, I think,’ said Trent.', '‘Nearer three!’ cried Quilp.', '‘How fast time flies.', 'Does it seem as\\nlong as that to you, Mrs Quilp?’\\n\\n‘Yes, I think it seems full three years, Quilp,’ was the unfortunate\\nreply.', '‘Oh indeed, ma’am,’ thought Quilp, ‘you have been pining, have you?', 'Very good, ma’am.’\\n\\n‘It seems to me but yesterday that you went out to Demerara in the Mary\\nAnne,’ said Quilp; ‘but yesterday, I declare.', 'Well, I like a little\\nwildness.', 'I was wild myself once.’\\n\\nMr Quilp accompanied this admission with such an awful wink, indicative\\nof old rovings and backslidings, that Mrs Jiniwin was indignant, and\\ncould not forbear from remarking under her breath that he might at\\nleast put off his confessions until his wife was absent; for which act\\nof boldness and insubordination Mr Quilp first stared her out of\\ncountenance and then drank her health ceremoniously.', '‘I thought you’d come back directly, Fred.', 'I always thought that,’\\nsaid Quilp setting down his glass.', '‘And when the Mary Anne returned\\nwith you on board, instead of a letter to say what a contrite heart you\\nhad, and how happy you were in the situation that had been provided for\\nyou, I was amused--exceedingly amused.', 'Ha ha ha!’\\n\\nThe young man smiled, but not as though the theme was the most\\nagreeable one that could have been selected for his entertainment; and\\nfor that reason Quilp pursued it.', '‘I always will say,’ he resumed, ‘that when a rich relation having two\\nyoung people--sisters or brothers, or brother and sister--dependent on\\nhim, attaches himself exclusively to one, and casts off the other, he\\ndoes wrong.’\\n\\nThe young man made a movement of impatience, but Quilp went on as\\ncalmly as if he were discussing some abstract question in which nobody\\npresent had the slightest personal interest.', '‘It’s very true,’ said Quilp, ‘that your grandfather urged repeated\\nforgiveness, ingratitude, riot, and extravagance, and all that; but as\\nI told him “these are common faults.”  “But he’s a scoundrel,” said he.', '“Granting that,” said I (for the sake of argument of course), “a great\\nmany young noblemen and gentlemen are scoundrels too!” But he wouldn’t\\nbe convinced.’\\n\\n‘I wonder at that, Mr Quilp,’ said the young man sarcastically.', '‘Well, so did I at the time,’ returned Quilp, ‘but he was always\\nobstinate.', 'He was in a manner a friend of mine, but he was always\\nobstinate and wrong-headed.', 'Little Nell is a nice girl, a charming\\ngirl, but you’re her brother, Frederick.', 'You’re her brother after all;\\nas you told him the last time you met, he can’t alter that.’\\n\\n‘He would if he could, confound him for that and all other kindnesses,’\\nsaid the young man impatiently.', '‘But nothing can come of this subject\\nnow, and let us have done with it in the Devil’s name.’\\n\\n‘Agreed,’ returned Quilp, ‘agreed on my part readily.', 'Why have I\\nalluded to it?', 'Just to show you, Frederick, that I have always stood\\nyour friend.', 'You little knew who was your friend, and who your foe;\\nnow did you?', 'You thought I was against you, and so there has been a\\ncoolness between us; but it was all on your side, entirely on your\\nside.', 'Let’s shake hands again, Fred.’\\n\\nWith his head sunk down between his shoulders, and a hideous grin\\nover-spreading his face, the dwarf stood up and stretched his short arm\\nacross the table.', 'After a moment’s hesitation, the young man stretched\\nout his to meet it; Quilp clutched his fingers in a grip that for the\\nmoment stopped the current of the blood within them, and pressing his\\nother hand upon his lip and frowning towards the unsuspicious Richard,\\nreleased them and sat down.', 'This action was not lost upon Trent, who, knowing that Richard\\nSwiveller was a mere tool in his hands and knew no more of his designs\\nthan he thought proper to communicate, saw that the dwarf perfectly\\nunderstood their relative position, and fully entered into the\\ncharacter of his friend.', 'It is something to be appreciated, even in\\nknavery.', 'This silent homage to his superior abilities, no less than a\\nsense of the power with which the dwarf’s quick perception had already\\ninvested him, inclined the young man towards that ugly worthy, and\\ndetermined him to profit by his aid.', 'It being now Mr Quilp’s cue to change the subject with all convenient\\nexpedition, lest Richard Swiveller in his heedlessness should reveal\\nanything which it was inexpedient for the women to know, he proposed a\\ngame at four-handed cribbage, and partners being cut for, Mrs Quilp\\nfell to Frederick Trent, and Dick himself to Quilp.', 'Mrs Jiniwin being\\nvery fond of cards was carefully excluded by her son-in-law from any\\nparticipation in the game, and had assigned to her the duty of\\noccasionally replenishing the glasses from the case-bottle; Mr Quilp\\nfrom that moment keeping one eye constantly upon her, lest she should\\nby any means procure a taste of the same, and thereby tantalising the\\nwretched old lady (who was as much attached to the case-bottle as the\\ncards) in a double degree and most ingenious manner.', 'But it was not to Mrs Jiniwin alone that Mr Quilp’s attention was\\nrestricted, as several other matters required his constant vigilance.', 'Among his various eccentric habits he had a humorous one of always\\ncheating at cards, which rendered necessary on his part, not only a\\nclose observance of the game, and a sleight-of-hand in counting and\\nscoring, but also involved the constant correction, by looks, and\\nfrowns, and kicks under the table, of Richard Swiveller, who being\\nbewildered by the rapidity with which his cards were told, and the rate\\nat which the pegs travelled down the board, could not be prevented from\\nsometimes expressing his surprise and incredulity.', 'Mrs Quilp too was\\nthe partner of young Trent, and for every look that passed between\\nthem, and every word they spoke, and every card they played, the dwarf\\nhad eyes and ears; not occupied alone with what was passing above the\\ntable, but with signals that might be exchanging beneath it, which he\\nlaid all kinds of traps to detect; besides often treading on his wife’s\\ntoes to see whether she cried out or remained silent under the\\ninfliction, in which latter case it would have been quite clear that\\nTrent had been treading on her toes before.', 'Yet, in the most of all\\nthese distractions, the one eye was upon the old lady always, and if\\nshe so much as stealthily advanced a tea-spoon towards a neighbouring\\nglass (which she often did), for the purpose of abstracting but one sup\\nof its sweet contents, Quilp’s hand would overset it in the very moment\\nof her triumph, and Quilp’s mocking voice implore her to regard her\\nprecious health.', 'And in any one of these his many cares, from first to\\nlast, Quilp never flagged nor faltered.', 'At length, when they had played a great many rubbers and drawn pretty\\nfreely upon the case-bottle, Mr Quilp warned his lady to retire to\\nrest, and that submissive wife complying, and being followed by her\\nindignant mother, Mr Swiveller fell asleep.', 'The dwarf beckoning his\\nremaining companion to the other end of the room, held a short\\nconference with him in whispers.', '‘It’s as well not to say more than one can help before our worthy\\nfriend,’ said Quilp, making a grimace towards the slumbering Dick.', '‘Is\\nit a bargain between us, Fred?', 'Shall he marry little rosy Nell\\nby-and-by?’\\n\\n‘You have some end of your own to answer, of course,’ returned the\\nother.', '‘Of course I have, dear Fred,’ said Quilp, grinning to think how little\\nhe suspected what the real end was.', '‘It’s retaliation perhaps; perhaps\\nwhim.', 'I have influence, Fred, to help or oppose.', 'Which way shall I\\nuse it?', 'There are a pair of scales, and it goes into one.’\\n\\n‘Throw it into mine then,’ said Trent.', '‘It’s done, Fred,’ rejoined Quilp, stretching out his clenched hand and\\nopening it as if he had let some weight fall out.', '‘It’s in the scale\\nfrom this time, and turns it, Fred.', 'Mind that.’\\n\\n‘Where have they gone?’ asked Trent.', 'Quilp shook his head, and said that point remained to be discovered,\\nwhich it might be, easily.', 'When it was, they would begin their\\npreliminary advances.', 'He would visit the old man, or even Richard\\nSwiveller might visit him, and by affecting a deep concern in his\\nbehalf, and imploring him to settle in some worthy home, lead to the\\nchild’s remembering him with gratitude and favour.', 'Once impressed to\\nthis extent, it would be easy, he said, to win her in a year or two,\\nfor she supposed the old man to be poor, as it was a part of his\\njealous policy (in common with many other misers) to feign to be so, to\\nthose about him.', '‘He has feigned it often enough to me, of late,’ said Trent.', '‘Oh!', 'and to me too!’ replied the dwarf.', '‘Which is more extraordinary,\\nas I know how rich he really is.’\\n\\n‘I suppose you should,’ said Trent.', '‘I think I should indeed,’ rejoined the dwarf; and in that, at least,\\nhe spoke the truth.', 'After a few more whispered words, they returned to the table, and the\\nyoung man rousing Richard Swiveller informed him that he was waiting to\\ndepart.', 'This was welcome news to Dick, who started up directly.', 'After\\na few words of confidence in the result of their project had been\\nexchanged, they bade the grinning Quilp good night.', 'Quilp crept to the window as they passed in the street below, and\\nlistened.', 'Trent was pronouncing an encomium upon his wife, and they\\nwere both wondering by what enchantment she had been brought to marry\\nsuch a misshapen wretch as he.', 'The dwarf after watching their\\nretreating shadows with a wider grin than his face had yet displayed,\\nstole softly in the dark to bed.', 'In this hatching of their scheme, neither Trent nor Quilp had had one\\nthought about the happiness or misery of poor innocent Nell.', 'It would\\nhave been strange if the careless profligate, who was the butt of both,\\nhad been harassed by any such consideration; for his high opinion of\\nhis own merits and deserts rendered the project rather a laudable one\\nthan otherwise; and if he had been visited by so unwonted a guest as\\nreflection, he would--being a brute only in the gratification of his\\nappetites--have soothed his conscience with the plea that he did not\\nmean to beat or kill his wife, and would therefore, after all said and\\ndone, be a very tolerable, average husband.', 'CHAPTER 24\\n\\nIt was not until they were quite exhausted and could no longer maintain\\nthe pace at which they had fled from the race-ground, that the old man\\nand the child ventured to stop, and sit down to rest upon the borders\\nof a little wood.', 'Here, though the course was hidden from their view,\\nthey could yet faintly distinguish the noise of distant shouts, the hum\\nof voices, and the beating of drums.', 'Climbing the eminence which lay\\nbetween them and the spot they had left, the child could even discern\\nthe fluttering flags and white tops of booths; but no person was\\napproaching towards them, and their resting-place was solitary and\\nstill.', 'Some time elapsed before she could reassure her trembling companion, or\\nrestore him to a state of moderate tranquillity.', 'His disordered\\nimagination represented to him a crowd of persons stealing towards them\\nbeneath the cover of the bushes, lurking in every ditch, and peeping\\nfrom the boughs of every rustling tree.', 'He was haunted by\\napprehensions of being led captive to some gloomy place where he would\\nbe chained and scourged, and worse than all, where Nell could never\\ncome to see him, save through iron bars and gratings in the wall.', 'His\\nterrors affected the child.', 'Separation from her grandfather was the\\ngreatest evil she could dread; and feeling for the time as though, go\\nwhere they would, they were to be hunted down, and could never be safe\\nbut in hiding, her heart failed her, and her courage drooped.', 'In one so young, and so unused to the scenes in which she had lately\\nmoved, this sinking of the spirit was not surprising.', 'But, Nature\\noften enshrines gallant and noble hearts in weak bosoms--oftenest, God\\nbless her, in female breasts--and when the child, casting her tearful\\neyes upon the old man, remembered how weak he was, and how destitute\\nand helpless he would be if she failed him, her heart swelled within\\nher, and animated her with new strength and fortitude.', '‘We are quite safe now, and have nothing to fear indeed, dear\\ngrandfather,’ she said.', '‘Nothing to fear!’ returned the old man.', '‘Nothing to fear if they took\\nme from thee!', 'Nothing to fear if they parted us!', 'Nobody is true to\\nme.', 'No, not one.', 'Not even Nell!’\\n\\n‘Oh!', 'do not say that,’ replied the child, ‘for if ever anybody was true\\nat heart, and earnest, I am.', 'I am sure you know I am.’\\n\\n‘Then how,’ said the old man, looking fearfully round, ‘how can you\\nbear to think that we are safe, when they are searching for me\\neverywhere, and may come here, and steal upon us, even while we’re\\ntalking?’\\n\\n‘Because I’m sure we have not been followed,’ said the child.', '‘Judge\\nfor yourself, dear grandfather: look round, and see how quiet and still\\nit is.', 'We are alone together, and may ramble where we like.', 'Not safe!', 'Could I feel easy--did I feel at ease--when any danger threatened you?’\\n\\n‘True, too,’ he answered, pressing her hand, but still looking\\nanxiously about.', '‘What noise was that?’\\n\\n‘A bird,’ said the child, ‘flying into the wood, and leading the way\\nfor us to follow.’  You remember that we said we would walk in woods\\nand fields, and by the side of rivers, and how happy we would be--you\\nremember that?', 'But here, while the sun shines above our heads, and\\neverything is bright and happy, we are sitting sadly down, and losing\\ntime.', 'See what a pleasant path; and there’s the bird--the same\\nbird--now he flies to another tree, and stays to sing.', 'Come!’\\n\\nWhen they rose up from the ground, and took the shady track which led\\nthem through the wood, she bounded on before, printing her tiny\\nfootsteps in the moss, which rose elastic from so light a pressure and\\ngave it back as mirrors throw off breath; and thus she lured the old\\nman on, with many a backward look and merry beck, now pointing\\nstealthily to some lone bird as it perched and twittered on a branch\\nthat strayed across their path, now stopping to listen to the songs\\nthat broke the happy silence, or watch the sun as it trembled through\\nthe leaves, and stealing in among the ivied trunks of stout old trees,\\nopened long paths of light.', 'As they passed onward, parting the boughs\\nthat clustered in their way, the serenity which the child had first\\nassumed, stole into her breast in earnest; the old man cast no longer\\nfearful looks behind, but felt at ease and cheerful, for the further\\nthey passed into the deep green shade, the more they felt that the\\ntranquil mind of God was there, and shed its peace on them.', 'At length the path becoming clearer and less intricate, brought them to\\nthe end of the wood, and into a public road.', 'Taking their way along it\\nfor a short distance, they came to a lane, so shaded by the trees on\\neither hand that they met together over-head, and arched the narrow\\nway.', 'A broken finger-post announced that this led to a village three\\nmiles off; and thither they resolved to bend their steps.', 'The miles appeared so long that they sometimes thought they must have\\nmissed their road.', 'But at last, to their great joy, it led downwards\\nin a steep descent, with overhanging banks over which the footpaths\\nled; and the clustered houses of the village peeped from the woody\\nhollow below.', 'It was a very small place.', 'The men and boys were playing at cricket on\\nthe green; and as the other folks were looking on, they wandered up and\\ndown, uncertain where to seek a humble lodging.', 'There was but one old\\nman in the little garden before his cottage, and him they were timid of\\napproaching, for he was the schoolmaster, and had ‘School’ written up\\nover his window in black letters on a white board.', 'He was a pale,\\nsimple-looking man, of a spare and meagre habit, and sat among his\\nflowers and beehives, smoking his pipe, in the little porch before his\\ndoor.', '‘Speak to him, dear,’ the old man whispered.', '‘I am almost afraid to disturb him,’ said the child timidly.', '‘He does\\nnot seem to see us.', 'Perhaps if we wait a little, he may look this way.’\\n\\nThey waited, but the schoolmaster cast no look towards them, and still\\nsat, thoughtful and silent, in the little porch.', 'He had a kind face.', 'In his plain old suit of black, he looked pale and meagre.', 'They\\nfancied, too, a lonely air about him and his house, but perhaps that\\nwas because the other people formed a merry company upon the green, and\\nhe seemed the only solitary man in all the place.', 'They were very tired, and the child would have been bold enough to\\naddress even a schoolmaster, but for something in his manner which\\nseemed to denote that he was uneasy or distressed.', 'As they stood\\nhesitating at a little distance, they saw that he sat for a few minutes\\nat a time like one in a brown study, then laid aside his pipe and took\\na few turns in his garden, then approached the gate and looked towards\\nthe green, then took up his pipe again with a sigh, and sat down\\nthoughtfully as before.', 'As nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark, Nell at length took\\ncourage, and when he had resumed his pipe and seat, ventured to draw\\nnear, leading her grandfather by the hand.', 'The slight noise they made\\nin raising the latch of the wicket-gate, caught his attention.', 'He\\nlooked at them kindly but seemed disappointed too, and slightly shook\\nhis head.', 'Nell dropped a curtsey, and told him they were poor travellers who\\nsought a shelter for the night which they would gladly pay for, so far\\nas their means allowed.', 'The schoolmaster looked earnestly at her as\\nshe spoke, laid aside his pipe, and rose up directly.', '‘If you could direct us anywhere, sir,’ said the child, ‘we should take\\nit very kindly.’\\n\\n‘You have been walking a long way,’ said the schoolmaster.', '‘A long way, Sir,’ the child replied.', '‘You’re a young traveller, my child,’ he said, laying his hand gently\\non her head.', '‘Your grandchild, friend?’\\n\\n‘Aye, Sir,’ cried the old man, ‘and the stay and comfort of my life.’\\n\\n‘Come in,’ said the schoolmaster.', 'Without further preface he conducted them into his little school-room,\\nwhich was parlour and kitchen likewise, and told them that they were\\nwelcome to remain under his roof till morning.', 'Before they had done\\nthanking him, he spread a coarse white cloth upon the table, with\\nknives and platters; and bringing out some bread and cold meat and a\\njug of beer, besought them to eat and drink.', 'The child looked round the room as she took her seat.', 'There were a\\ncouple of forms, notched and cut and inked all over; a small deal desk\\nperched on four legs, at which no doubt the master sat; a few\\ndog’s-eared books upon a high shelf; and beside them a motley\\ncollection of peg-tops, balls, kites, fishing-lines, marbles,\\nhalf-eaten apples, and other confiscated property of idle urchins.', 'Displayed on hooks upon the wall in all their terrors, were the cane\\nand ruler; and near them, on a small shelf of its own, the dunce’s cap,\\nmade of old newspapers and decorated with glaring wafers of the largest\\nsize.', 'But, the great ornaments of the walls were certain moral\\nsentences fairly copied in good round text, and well-worked sums in\\nsimple addition and multiplication, evidently achieved by the same\\nhand, which were plentifully pasted all round the room: for the double\\npurpose, as it seemed, of bearing testimony to the excellence of the\\nschool, and kindling a worthy emulation in the bosoms of the scholars.', '‘Yes,’ said the old schoolmaster, observing that her attention was\\ncaught by these latter specimens.', '‘That’s beautiful writing, my dear.’\\n\\n‘Very, Sir,’ replied the child modestly, ‘is it yours?’\\n\\n‘Mine!’ he returned, taking out his spectacles and putting them on, to\\nhave a better view of the triumphs so dear to his heart.', '‘I couldn’t\\nwrite like that, now-a-days.', 'No.', 'They’re all done by one hand; a\\nlittle hand it is, not so old as yours, but a very clever one.’\\n\\nAs the schoolmaster said this, he saw that a small blot of ink had been\\nthrown on one of the copies, so he took a penknife from his pocket, and\\ngoing up to the wall, carefully scraped it out.', 'When he had finished,\\nhe walked slowly backward from the writing, admiring it as one might\\ncontemplate a beautiful picture, but with something of sadness in his\\nvoice and manner which quite touched the child, though she was\\nunacquainted with its cause.', '‘A little hand indeed,’ said the poor schoolmaster.', '‘Far beyond all\\nhis companions, in his learning and his sports too, how did he ever\\ncome to be so fond of me!', 'That I should love him is no wonder, but\\nthat he should love me--’ and there the schoolmaster stopped, and took\\noff his spectacles to wipe them, as though they had grown dim.', '‘I hope there is nothing the matter, sir,’ said Nell anxiously.', '‘Not much, my dear,’ returned the schoolmaster.', '‘I hoped to have seen\\nhim on the green to-night.', 'He was always foremost among them.', 'But\\nhe’ll be there to-morrow.’\\n\\n‘Has he been ill?’ asked the child, with a child’s quick sympathy.', '‘Not very.', 'They said he was wandering in his head yesterday, dear boy,\\nand so they said the day before.', 'But that’s a part of that kind of\\ndisorder; it’s not a bad sign--not at all a bad sign.’\\n\\nThe child was silent.', 'He walked to the door, and looked wistfully out.', 'The shadows of night were gathering, and all was still.', '‘If he could lean upon anybody’s arm, he would come to me, I know,’ he\\nsaid, returning into the room.', '‘He always came into the garden to say\\ngood night.', 'But perhaps his illness has only just taken a favourable\\nturn, and it’s too late for him to come out, for it’s very damp and\\nthere’s a heavy dew.', 'It’s much better he shouldn’t come to-night.’\\n\\nThe schoolmaster lighted a candle, fastened the window-shutter, and\\nclosed the door.', 'But after he had done this, and sat silent a little\\ntime, he took down his hat, and said he would go and satisfy himself,\\nif Nell would sit up till he returned.', 'The child readily complied, and\\nhe went out.', 'She sat there half-an-hour or more, feeling the place very strange and\\nlonely, for she had prevailed upon the old man to go to bed, and there\\nwas nothing to be heard but the ticking of an old clock, and the\\nwhistling of the wind among the trees.', 'When he returned, he took his\\nseat in the chimney corner, but remained silent for a long time.', 'At\\nlength he turned to her, and speaking very gently, hoped she would say\\na prayer that night for a sick child.', '‘My favourite scholar!’ said the poor schoolmaster, smoking a pipe he\\nhad forgotten to light, and looking mournfully round upon the walls.', '‘It is a little hand to have done all that, and waste away with\\nsickness.', 'It is a very, very little hand!’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 25\\n\\nAfter a sound night’s rest in a chamber in the thatched roof, in which\\nit seemed the sexton had for some years been a lodger, but which he had\\nlately deserted for a wife and a cottage of his own, the child rose\\nearly in the morning and descended to the room where she had supped\\nlast night.', 'As the schoolmaster had already left his bed and gone out,\\nshe bestirred herself to make it neat and comfortable, and had just\\nfinished its arrangement when the kind host returned.', 'He thanked her many times, and said that the old dame who usually did\\nsuch offices for him had gone to nurse the little scholar whom he had\\ntold her of.', 'The child asked how he was, and hoped he was better.', '‘No,’ rejoined the schoolmaster shaking his head sorrowfully, ‘no\\nbetter.', 'They even say he is worse.’\\n\\n‘I am very sorry for that, Sir,’ said the child.', 'The poor schoolmaster appeared to be gratified by her earnest manner,\\nbut yet rendered more uneasy by it, for he added hastily that anxious\\npeople often magnified an evil and thought it greater than it was; ‘for\\nmy part,’ he said, in his quiet, patient way, ‘I hope it’s not so.', 'I\\ndon’t think he can be worse.’\\n\\nThe child asked his leave to prepare breakfast, and her grandfather\\ncoming down stairs, they all three partook of it together.', 'While the\\nmeal was in progress, their host remarked that the old man seemed much\\nfatigued, and evidently stood in need of rest.', '‘If the journey you have before you is a long one,’ he said, ‘and don’t\\npress you for one day, you’re very welcome to pass another night here.', 'I should really be glad if you would, friend.’\\n\\nHe saw that the old man looked at Nell, uncertain whether to accept or\\ndecline his offer; and added,\\n\\n‘I shall be glad to have your young companion with me for one day.', 'If\\nyou can do a charity to a lone man, and rest yourself at the same time,\\ndo so.', 'If you must proceed upon your journey, I wish you well through\\nit, and will walk a little way with you before school begins.’\\n\\n‘What are we to do, Nell?’ said the old man irresolutely, ‘say what\\nwe’re to do, dear.’\\n\\nIt required no great persuasion to induce the child to answer that they\\nhad better accept the invitation and remain.', 'She was happy to show her\\ngratitude to the kind schoolmaster by busying herself in the\\nperformance of such household duties as his little cottage stood in\\nneed of.', 'When these were done, she took some needle-work from her\\nbasket, and sat herself down upon a stool beside the lattice, where the\\nhoneysuckle and woodbine entwined their tender stems, and stealing into\\nthe room filled it with their delicious breath.', 'Her grandfather was\\nbasking in the sun outside, breathing the perfume of the flowers, and\\nidly watching the clouds as they floated on before the light summer\\nwind.', 'As the schoolmaster, after arranging the two forms in due order, took\\nhis seat behind his desk and made other preparations for school, the\\nchild was apprehensive that she might be in the way, and offered to\\nwithdraw to her little bedroom.', 'But this he would not allow, and as he\\nseemed pleased to have her there, she remained, busying herself with\\nher work.', '‘Have you many scholars, sir?’ she asked.', 'The poor schoolmaster shook his head, and said that they barely filled\\nthe two forms.', '‘Are the others clever, sir?’ asked the child, glancing at the trophies\\non the wall.', '‘Good boys,’ returned the schoolmaster, ‘good boys enough, my dear, but\\nthey’ll never do like that.’\\n\\nA small white-headed boy with a sunburnt face appeared at the door\\nwhile he was speaking, and stopping there to make a rustic bow, came in\\nand took his seat upon one of the forms.', 'The white-headed boy then put\\nan open book, astonishingly dog’s-eared upon his knees, and thrusting\\nhis hands into his pockets began counting the marbles with which they\\nwere filled; displaying in the expression of his face a remarkable\\ncapacity of totally abstracting his mind from the spelling on which his\\neyes were fixed.', 'Soon afterwards another white-headed little boy came\\nstraggling in, and after him a red-headed lad, and after him two more\\nwith white heads, and then one with a flaxen poll, and so on until the\\nforms were occupied by a dozen boys or thereabouts, with heads of every\\ncolour but grey, and ranging in their ages from four years old to\\nfourteen years or more; for the legs of the youngest were a long way\\nfrom the floor when he sat upon the form, and the eldest was a heavy\\ngood-tempered foolish fellow, about half a head taller than the\\nschoolmaster.', 'At the top of the first form--the post of honour in the school--was the\\nvacant place of the little sick scholar, and at the head of the row of\\npegs on which those who came in hats or caps were wont to hang them up,\\none was left empty.', 'No boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat\\nor peg, but many a one looked from the empty spaces to the\\nschoolmaster, and whispered his idle neighbour behind his hand.', 'Then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart,\\nthe whispered jest and stealthy game, and all the noise and drawl of\\nschool; and in the midst of the din sat the poor schoolmaster, the very\\nimage of meekness and simplicity, vainly attempting to fix his mind\\nupon the duties of the day, and to forget his little friend.', 'But the\\ntedium of his office reminded him more strongly of the willing scholar,\\nand his thoughts were rambling from his pupils--it was plain.', 'None knew this better than the idlest boys, who, growing bolder with\\nimpunity, waxed louder and more daring; playing odd-or-even under the\\nmaster’s eye, eating apples openly and without rebuke, pinching each\\nother in sport or malice without the least reserve, and cutting their\\nautographs in the very legs of his desk.', 'The puzzled dunce, who stood\\nbeside it to say his lesson out of book, looked no longer at the\\nceiling for forgotten words, but drew closer to the master’s elbow and\\nboldly cast his eye upon the page; the wag of the little troop squinted\\nand made grimaces (at the smallest boy of course), holding no book\\nbefore his face, and his approving audience knew no constraint in their\\ndelight.', 'If the master did chance to rouse himself and seem alive to\\nwhat was going on, the noise subsided for a moment and no eyes met his\\nbut wore a studious and a deeply humble look; but the instant he\\nrelapsed again, it broke out afresh, and ten times louder than before.', 'Oh!', 'how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside, and how they\\nlooked at the open door and window, as if they half meditated rushing\\nviolently out, plunging into the woods, and being wild boys and savages\\nfrom that time forth.', 'What rebellious thoughts of the cool river, and\\nsome shady bathing-place beneath willow trees with branches dipping in\\nthe water, kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy, who, with his\\nshirt-collar unbuttoned and flung back as far as it could go, sat\\nfanning his flushed face with a spelling-book, wishing himself a whale,\\nor a tittlebat, or a fly, or anything but a boy at school on that hot,\\nbroiling day!', 'Heat!', 'ask that other boy, whose seat being nearest to\\nthe door gave him opportunities of gliding out into the garden and\\ndriving his companions to madness by dipping his face into the bucket\\nof the well and then rolling on the grass--ask him if there were ever\\nsuch a day as that, when even the bees were diving deep down into the\\ncups of flowers and stopping there, as if they had made up their minds\\nto retire from business and be manufacturers of honey no more.', 'The day\\nwas made for laziness, and lying on one’s back in green places, and\\nstaring at the sky till its brightness forced one to shut one’s eyes\\nand go to sleep; and was this a time to be poring over musty books in a\\ndark room, slighted by the very sun itself?', 'Monstrous!', 'Nell sat by the window occupied with her work, but attentive still to\\nall that passed, though sometimes rather timid of the boisterous boys.', 'The lessons over, writing time began; and there being but one desk and\\nthat the master’s, each boy sat at it in turn and laboured at his\\ncrooked copy, while the master walked about.', 'This was a quieter time;\\nfor he would come and look over the writer’s shoulder, and tell him\\nmildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the\\nwall, praise such an up-stroke here and such a down-stroke there, and\\nbid him take it for his model.', 'Then he would stop and tell them what\\nthe sick child had said last night, and how he had longed to be among\\nthem once again; and such was the poor schoolmaster’s gentle and\\naffectionate manner, that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they\\nhad worried him so much, and were absolutely quiet; eating no apples,\\ncutting no names, inflicting no pinches, and making no grimaces, for\\nfull two minutes afterwards.', '‘I think, boys,’ said the schoolmaster when the clock struck twelve,\\n‘that I shall give an extra half-holiday this afternoon.’\\n\\nAt this intelligence, the boys, led on and headed by the tall boy,\\nraised a great shout, in the midst of which the master was seen to\\nspeak, but could not be heard.', 'As he held up his hand, however, in\\ntoken of his wish that they should be silent, they were considerate\\nenough to leave off, as soon as the longest-winded among them were\\nquite out of breath.', '‘You must promise me first,’ said the schoolmaster, ‘that you’ll not be\\nnoisy, or at least, if you are, that you’ll go away and be so--away out\\nof the village I mean.', 'I’m sure you wouldn’t disturb your old playmate\\nand companion.’\\n\\nThere was a general murmur (and perhaps a very sincere one, for they\\nwere but boys) in the negative; and the tall boy, perhaps as sincerely\\nas any of them, called those about him to witness that he had only\\nshouted in a whisper.', '‘Then pray don’t forget, there’s my dear scholars,’ said the\\nschoolmaster, ‘what I have asked you, and do it as a favour to me.', 'Be\\nas happy as you can, and don’t be unmindful that you are blessed with\\nhealth.', 'Good-bye all!’\\n\\n‘Thank’ee, Sir,’ and ‘good-bye, Sir,’ were said a good many times in a\\nvariety of voices, and the boys went out very slowly and softly.', 'But\\nthere was the sun shining and there were the birds singing, as the sun\\nonly shines and the birds only sing on holidays and half-holidays;\\nthere were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among\\ntheir leafy branches; the hay, entreating them to come and scatter it\\nto the pure air; the green corn, gently beckoning towards wood and\\nstream; the smooth ground, rendered smoother still by blending lights\\nand shadows, inviting to runs and leaps, and long walks God knows\\nwhither.', 'It was more than boy could bear, and with a joyous whoop the\\nwhole cluster took to their heels and spread themselves about, shouting\\nand laughing as they went.', '‘It’s natural, thank Heaven!’ said the poor schoolmaster, looking after\\nthem.', '‘I’m very glad they didn’t mind me!’\\n\\nIt is difficult, however, to please everybody, as most of us would have\\ndiscovered, even without the fable which bears that moral, and in the\\ncourse of the afternoon several mothers and aunts of pupils looked in\\nto express their entire disapproval of the schoolmaster’s proceeding.', 'A few confined themselves to hints, such as politely inquiring what\\nred-letter day or saint’s day the almanack said it was; a few (these\\nwere the profound village politicians) argued that it was a slight to\\nthe throne and an affront to church and state, and savoured of\\nrevolutionary principles, to grant a half-holiday upon any lighter\\noccasion than the birthday of the Monarch; but the majority expressed\\ntheir displeasure on private grounds and in plain terms, arguing that\\nto put the pupils on this short allowance of learning was nothing but\\nan act of downright robbery and fraud: and one old lady, finding that\\nshe could not inflame or irritate the peaceable schoolmaster by talking\\nto him, bounced out of his house and talked at him for half-an-hour\\noutside his own window, to another old lady, saying that of course he\\nwould deduct this half-holiday from his weekly charge, or of course he\\nwould naturally expect to have an opposition started against him; there\\nwas no want of idle chaps in that neighbourhood (here the old lady\\nraised her voice), and some chaps who were too idle even to be\\nschoolmasters, might soon find that there were other chaps put over\\ntheir heads, and so she would have them take care, and look pretty\\nsharp about them.', 'But all these taunts and vexations failed to elicit\\none word from the meek schoolmaster, who sat with the child by his\\nside--a little more dejected perhaps, but quite silent and\\nuncomplaining.', 'Towards night an old woman came tottering up the garden as speedily as\\nshe could, and meeting the schoolmaster at the door, said he was to go\\nto Dame West’s directly, and had best run on before her.', 'He and the\\nchild were on the point of going out together for a walk, and without\\nrelinquishing her hand, the schoolmaster hurried away, leaving the\\nmessenger to follow as she might.', 'They stopped at a cottage-door, and the schoolmaster knocked softly at\\nit with his hand.', 'It was opened without loss of time.', 'They entered a\\nroom where a little group of women were gathered about one, older than\\nthe rest, who was crying very bitterly, and sat wringing her hands and\\nrocking herself to and fro.', '‘Oh, dame!’ said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair, ‘is it so\\nbad as this?’\\n\\n‘He’s going fast,’ cried the old woman; ‘my grandson’s dying.', 'It’s all\\nalong of you.', 'You shouldn’t see him now, but for his being so earnest\\non it.', 'This is what his learning has brought him to.', 'Oh dear, dear,\\ndear, what can I do!’\\n\\n‘Do not say that I am in any fault,’ urged the gentle school-master.', '‘I am not hurt, dame.', 'No, no.', 'You are in great distress of mind, and\\ndon’t mean what you say.', 'I am sure you don’t.’\\n\\n‘I do,’ returned the old woman.', '‘I mean it all.', 'If he hadn’t been\\nporing over his books out of fear of you, he would have been well and\\nmerry now, I know he would.’\\n\\nThe schoolmaster looked round upon the other women as if to entreat\\nsome one among them to say a kind word for him, but they shook their\\nheads, and murmured to each other that they never thought there was\\nmuch good in learning, and that this convinced them.', 'Without saying a\\nword in reply, or giving them a look of reproach, he followed the old\\nwoman who had summoned him (and who had now rejoined them) into another\\nroom, where his infant friend, half-dressed, lay stretched upon a bed.', 'He was a very young boy; quite a little child.', 'His hair still hung in\\ncurls about his face, and his eyes were very bright; but their light\\nwas of Heaven, not earth.', 'The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and\\nstooping over the pillow, whispered his name.', 'The boy sprung up,\\nstroked his face with his hand, and threw his wasted arms round his\\nneck, crying out that he was his dear kind friend.', '‘I hope I always was.', 'I meant to be, God knows,’ said the poor\\nschoolmaster.', '‘Who is that?’ said the boy, seeing Nell.', '‘I am afraid to kiss her,\\nlest I should make her ill.', 'Ask her to shake hands with me.’\\n\\nThe sobbing child came closer up, and took the little languid hand in\\nhers.', 'Releasing his again after a time, the sick boy laid him gently\\ndown.', '‘You remember the garden, Harry,’ whispered the schoolmaster, anxious\\nto rouse him, for a dulness seemed gathering upon the child, ‘and how\\npleasant it used to be in the evening time?', 'You must make haste to\\nvisit it again, for I think the very flowers have missed you, and are\\nless gay than they used to be.', 'You will come soon, my dear, very soon\\nnow--won’t you?’\\n\\nThe boy smiled faintly--so very, very faintly--and put his hand upon\\nhis friend’s grey head.', 'He moved his lips too, but no voice came from\\nthem; no, not a sound.', 'In the silence that ensued, the hum of distant voices borne upon the\\nevening air came floating through the open window.', '‘What’s that?’ said\\nthe sick child, opening his eyes.', '‘The boys at play upon the green.’\\n\\nHe took a handkerchief from his pillow, and tried to wave it above his\\nhead.', 'But the feeble arm dropped powerless down.', '‘Shall I do it?’ said the schoolmaster.', '‘Please wave it at the window,’ was the faint reply.', '‘Tie it to the\\nlattice.', 'Some of them may see it there.', 'Perhaps they’ll think of me,\\nand look this way.’\\n\\nHe raised his head, and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle\\nbat, that lay with slate and book and other boyish property upon a\\ntable in the room.', 'And then he laid him softly down once more, and\\nasked if the little girl were there, for he could not see her.', 'She stepped forward, and pressed the passive hand that lay upon the\\ncoverlet.', 'The two old friends and companions--for such they were,\\nthough they were man and child--held each other in a long embrace, and\\nthen the little scholar turned his face towards the wall, and fell\\nasleep.', 'The poor schoolmaster sat in the same place, holding the small cold\\nhand in his, and chafing it.', 'It was but the hand of a dead child.', 'He\\nfelt that; and yet he chafed it still, and could not lay it down.', 'CHAPTER 26\\n\\nAlmost broken-hearted, Nell withdrew with the schoolmaster from the\\nbedside and returned to his cottage.', 'In the midst of her grief and\\ntears she was yet careful to conceal their real cause from the old man,\\nfor the dead boy had been a grandchild, and left but one aged relative\\nto mourn his premature decay.', 'She stole away to bed as quickly as she could, and when she was alone,\\ngave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged.', 'But the sad scene she had witnessed, was not without its lesson of\\ncontent and gratitude; of content with the lot which left her health\\nand freedom; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and\\nfriend she loved, and to live and move in a beautiful world, when so\\nmany young creatures--as young and full of hope as she--were stricken\\ndown and gathered to their graves.', 'How many of the mounds in that old\\nchurchyard where she had lately strayed, grew green above the graves of\\nchildren!', 'And though she thought as a child herself, and did not\\nperhaps sufficiently consider to what a bright and happy existence\\nthose who die young are borne, and how in death they lose the pain of\\nseeing others die around them, bearing to the tomb some strong\\naffection of their hearts (which makes the old die many times in one\\nlong life), still she thought wisely enough, to draw a plain and easy\\nmoral from what she had seen that night, and to store it, deep in her\\nmind.', 'Her dreams were of the little scholar: not coffined and covered up, but\\nmingling with angels, and smiling happily.', 'The sun darting his\\ncheerful rays into the room, awoke her; and now there remained but to\\ntake leave of the poor schoolmaster and wander forth once more.', 'By the time they were ready to depart, school had begun.', 'In the\\ndarkened room, the din of yesterday was going on again: a little\\nsobered and softened down, perhaps, but only a very little, if at all.', 'The schoolmaster rose from his desk and walked with them to the gate.', 'It was with a trembling and reluctant hand, that the child held out to\\nhim the money which the lady had given her at the races for her\\nflowers: faltering in her thanks as she thought how small the sum was,\\nand blushing as she offered it.', 'But he bade her put it up, and\\nstooping to kiss her cheek, turned back into his house.', 'They had not gone half-a-dozen paces when he was at the door again; the\\nold man retraced his steps to shake hands, and the child did the same.', '‘Good fortune and happiness go with you!’ said the poor schoolmaster.', '‘I am quite a solitary man now.', 'If you ever pass this way again,\\nyou’ll not forget the little village-school.’\\n\\n‘We shall never forget it, sir,’ rejoined Nell; ‘nor ever forget to be\\ngrateful to you for your kindness to us.’\\n\\n‘I have heard such words from the lips of children very often,’ said\\nthe schoolmaster, shaking his head, and smiling thoughtfully, ‘but they\\nwere soon forgotten.', 'I had attached one young friend to me, the better\\nfriend for being young--but that’s over--God bless you!’\\n\\nThey bade him farewell very many times, and turned away, walking slowly\\nand often looking back, until they could see him no more.', 'At length\\nthey had left the village far behind, and even lost sight of the smoke\\namong the trees.', 'They trudged onward now, at a quicker pace, resolving\\nto keep the main road, and go wherever it might lead them.', 'But main roads stretch a long, long way.', 'With the exception of two or\\nthree inconsiderable clusters of cottages which they passed, without\\nstopping, and one lonely road-side public-house where they had some\\nbread and cheese, this highway had led them to nothing--late in the\\nafternoon--and still lengthened out, far in the distance, the same\\ndull, tedious, winding course, that they had been pursuing all day.', 'As\\nthey had no resource, however, but to go forward, they still kept on,\\nthough at a much slower pace, being very weary and fatigued.', 'The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful evening, when they arrived\\nat a point where the road made a sharp turn and struck across a common.', 'On the border of this common, and close to the hedge which divided it\\nfrom the cultivated fields, a caravan was drawn up to rest; upon which,\\nby reason of its situation, they came so suddenly that they could not\\nhave avoided it if they would.', 'It was not a shabby, dingy, dusty cart, but a smart little house upon\\nwheels, with white dimity curtains festooning the windows, and\\nwindow-shutters of green picked out with panels of a staring red, in\\nwhich happily-contrasted colours the whole concern shone brilliant.', 'Neither was it a poor caravan drawn by a single donkey or emaciated\\nhorse, for a pair of horses in pretty good condition were released from\\nthe shafts and grazing on the frouzy grass.', 'Neither was it a gipsy\\ncaravan, for at the open door (graced with a bright brass knocker) sat\\na Christian lady, stout and comfortable to look upon, who wore a large\\nbonnet trembling with bows.', 'And that it was not an unprovided or\\ndestitute caravan was clear from this lady’s occupation, which was the\\nvery pleasant and refreshing one of taking tea.', 'The tea-things,\\nincluding a bottle of rather suspicious character and a cold knuckle of\\nham, were set forth upon a drum, covered with a white napkin; and\\nthere, as if at the most convenient round-table in all the world, sat\\nthis roving lady, taking her tea and enjoying the prospect.', 'It happened that at that moment the lady of the caravan had her cup\\n(which, that everything about her might be of a stout and comfortable\\nkind, was a breakfast cup) to her lips, and that having her eyes lifted\\nto the sky in her enjoyment of the full flavour of the tea, not\\nunmingled possibly with just the slightest dash or gleam of something\\nout of the suspicious bottle--but this is mere speculation and not\\ndistinct matter of history--it happened that being thus agreeably\\nengaged, she did not see the travellers when they first came up.', 'It\\nwas not until she was in the act of getting down the cup, and drawing a\\nlong breath after the exertion of causing its contents to disappear,\\nthat the lady of the caravan beheld an old man and a young child\\nwalking slowly by, and glancing at her proceedings with eyes of modest\\nbut hungry admiration.', '‘Hey!’ cried the lady of the caravan, scooping the crumbs out of her\\nlap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips.', '‘Yes, to be\\nsure--Who won the Helter-Skelter Plate, child?’\\n\\n‘Won what, ma’am?’ asked Nell.', '‘The Helter-Skelter Plate at the races, child--the plate that was run\\nfor on the second day.’\\n\\n‘On the second day, ma’am?’\\n\\n‘Second day!', 'Yes, second day,’ repeated the lady with an air of\\nimpatience.', '‘Can’t you say who won the Helter-Skelter Plate when\\nyou’re asked the question civilly?’\\n\\n‘I don’t know, ma’am.’\\n\\n‘Don’t know!’ repeated the lady of the caravan; ‘why, you were there.', 'I saw you with my own eyes.’\\n\\nNell was not a little alarmed to hear this, supposing that the lady\\nmight be intimately acquainted with the firm of Short and Codlin; but\\nwhat followed tended to reassure her.', '‘And very sorry I was,’ said the lady of the caravan, ‘to see you in\\ncompany with a Punch; a low, practical, wulgar wretch, that people\\nshould scorn to look at.’\\n\\n‘I was not there by choice,’ returned the child; ‘we didn’t know our\\nway, and the two men were very kind to us, and let us travel with them.', 'Do you--do you know them, ma’am?’\\n\\n‘Know ‘em, child!’ cried the lady of the caravan in a sort of shriek.', '‘Know them!', 'But you’re young and inexperienced, and that’s your excuse\\nfor asking sich a question.', 'Do I look as if I know’d ‘em, does the\\ncaravan look as if it know’d ‘em?’\\n\\n‘No, ma’am, no,’ said the child, fearing she had committed some\\ngrievous fault.', '‘I beg your pardon.’\\n\\nIt was granted immediately, though the lady still appeared much ruffled\\nand discomposed by the degrading supposition.', 'The child then explained\\nthat they had left the races on the first day, and were travelling to\\nthe next town on that road, where they purposed to spend the night.', 'As\\nthe countenance of the stout lady began to clear up, she ventured to\\ninquire how far it was.', 'The reply--which the stout lady did not come\\nto, until she had thoroughly explained that she went to the races on\\nthe first day in a gig, and as an expedition of pleasure, and that her\\npresence there had no connexion with any matters of business or\\nprofit--was, that the town was eight miles off.', 'This discouraging information a little dashed the child, who could\\nscarcely repress a tear as she glanced along the darkening road.', 'Her\\ngrandfather made no complaint, but he sighed heavily as he leaned upon\\nhis staff, and vainly tried to pierce the dusty distance.', 'The lady of the caravan was in the act of gathering her tea equipage\\ntogether preparatory to clearing the table, but noting the child’s\\nanxious manner she hesitated and stopped.', 'The child curtseyed, thanked\\nher for her information, and giving her hand to the old man had already\\ngot some fifty yards or so away, when the lady of the caravan called to\\nher to return.', '‘Come nearer, nearer still,’ said she, beckoning to her to ascend the\\nsteps.', '‘Are you hungry, child?’\\n\\n‘Not very, but we are tired, and it’s--it IS a long way.’\\n\\n‘Well, hungry or not, you had better have some tea,’ rejoined her new\\nacquaintance.', '‘I suppose you are agreeable to that, old gentleman?’\\n\\nThe grandfather humbly pulled off his hat and thanked her.', 'The lady of\\nthe caravan then bade him come up the steps likewise, but the drum\\nproving an inconvenient table for two, they descended again, and sat\\nupon the grass, where she handed down to them the tea-tray, the bread\\nand butter, the knuckle of ham, and in short everything of which she\\nhad partaken herself, except the bottle which she had already embraced\\nan opportunity of slipping into her pocket.', '‘Set ‘em out near the hind wheels, child, that’s the best place,’ said\\ntheir friend, superintending the arrangements from above.', '‘Now hand up\\nthe teapot for a little more hot water, and a pinch of fresh tea, and\\nthen both of you eat and drink as much as you can, and don’t spare\\nanything; that’s all I ask of you.’\\n\\nThey might perhaps have carried out the lady’s wish, if it had been\\nless freely expressed, or even if it had not been expressed at all.', 'But as this direction relieved them from any shadow of delicacy or\\nuneasiness, they made a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the utmost.', 'While they were thus engaged, the lady of the caravan alighted on the\\nearth, and with her hands clasped behind her, and her large bonnet\\ntrembling excessively, walked up and down in a measured tread and very\\nstately manner, surveying the caravan from time to time with an air of\\ncalm delight, and deriving particular gratification from the red panels\\nand the brass knocker.', 'When she had taken this gentle exercise for\\nsome time, she sat down upon the steps and called ‘George’; whereupon a\\nman in a carter’s frock, who had been so shrouded in a hedge up to this\\ntime as to see everything that passed without being seen himself,\\nparted the twigs that concealed him, and appeared in a sitting\\nattitude, supporting on his legs a baking-dish and a half-gallon stone\\nbottle, and bearing in his right hand a knife, and in his left a fork.', '‘Yes, Missus,’ said George.', '‘How did you find the cold pie, George?’\\n\\n‘It warn’t amiss, mum.’\\n\\n‘And the beer,’ said the lady of the caravan, with an appearance of\\nbeing more interested in this question than the last; ‘is it passable,\\nGeorge?’\\n\\n‘It’s more flatterer than it might be,’ George returned, ‘but it an’t\\nso bad for all that.’\\n\\nTo set the mind of his mistress at rest, he took a sip (amounting in\\nquantity to a pint or thereabouts) from the stone bottle, and then\\nsmacked his lips, winked his eye, and nodded his head.', 'No doubt with\\nthe same amiable desire, he immediately resumed his knife and fork, as\\na practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his\\nappetite.', 'The lady of the caravan looked on approvingly for some time, and then\\nsaid,\\n\\n‘Have you nearly finished?’\\n\\n‘Wery nigh, mum.’  And indeed, after scraping the dish all round with\\nhis knife and carrying the choice brown morsels to his mouth, and after\\ntaking such a scientific pull at the stone bottle that, by degrees\\nalmost imperceptible to the sight, his head went further and further\\nback until he lay nearly at his full length upon the ground, this\\ngentleman declared himself quite disengaged, and came forth from his\\nretreat.', '‘I hope I haven’t hurried you, George,’ said his mistress, who appeared\\nto have a great sympathy with his late pursuit.', '‘If you have,’ returned the follower, wisely reserving himself for any\\nfavourable contingency that might occur, ‘we must make up for it next\\ntime, that’s all.’\\n\\n‘We are not a heavy load, George?’\\n\\n‘That’s always what the ladies say,’ replied the man, looking a long\\nway round, as if he were appealing to Nature in general against such\\nmonstrous propositions.', '‘If you see a woman a driving, you’ll always\\nperceive that she never will keep her whip still; the horse can’t go\\nfast enough for her.', 'If cattle have got their proper load, you never\\ncan persuade a woman that they’ll not bear something more.', 'What is the\\ncause of this here?’\\n\\n‘Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses, if we\\ntook them with us?’ asked his mistress, offering no reply to the\\nphilosophical inquiry, and pointing to Nell and the old man, who were\\npainfully preparing to resume their journey on foot.', '‘They’d make a difference in course,’ said George doggedly.', '‘Would they make much difference?’ repeated his mistress.', '‘They can’t\\nbe very heavy.’\\n\\n‘The weight o’ the pair, mum,’ said George, eyeing them with the look\\nof a man who was calculating within half an ounce or so, ‘would be a\\ntrifle under that of Oliver Cromwell.’\\n\\nNell was very much surprised that the man should be so accurately\\nacquainted with the weight of one whom she had read of in books as\\nhaving lived considerably before their time, but speedily forgot the\\nsubject in the joy of hearing that they were to go forward in the\\ncaravan, for which she thanked its lady with unaffected earnestness.', 'She helped with great readiness and alacrity to put away the tea-things\\nand other matters that were lying about, and, the horses being by that\\ntime harnessed, mounted into the vehicle, followed by her delighted\\ngrandfather.', 'Their patroness then shut the door and sat herself down\\nby her drum at an open window; and, the steps being struck by George\\nand stowed under the carriage, away they went, with a great noise of\\nflapping and creaking and straining, and the bright brass knocker,\\nwhich nobody ever knocked at, knocking one perpetual double knock of\\nits own accord as they jolted heavily along.', 'CHAPTER 27\\n\\nWhen they had travelled slowly forward for some short distance, Nell\\nventured to steal a look round the caravan and observe it more closely.', 'One half of it--that moiety in which the comfortable proprietress was\\nthen seated--was carpeted, and so partitioned off at the further end as\\nto accommodate a sleeping-place, constructed after the fashion of a\\nberth on board ship, which was shaded, like the little windows, with\\nfair white curtains, and looked comfortable enough, though by what kind\\nof gymnastic exercise the lady of the caravan ever contrived to get\\ninto it, was an unfathomable mystery.', 'The other half served for a\\nkitchen, and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed\\nthrough the roof.', 'It held also a closet or larder, several chests, a\\ngreat pitcher of water, and a few cooking-utensils and articles of\\ncrockery.', 'These latter necessaries hung upon the walls, which, in that\\nportion of the establishment devoted to the lady of the caravan, were\\nornamented with such gayer and lighter decorations as a triangle and a\\ncouple of well-thumbed tambourines.', 'The lady of the caravan sat at one window in all the pride and poetry\\nof the musical instruments, and little Nell and her grandfather sat at\\nthe other in all the humility of the kettle and saucepans, while the\\nmachine jogged on and shifted the darkening prospect very slowly.', 'At\\nfirst the two travellers spoke little, and only in whispers, but as\\nthey grew more familiar with the place they ventured to converse with\\ngreater freedom, and talked about the country through which they were\\npassing, and the different objects that presented themselves, until the\\nold man fell asleep; which the lady of the caravan observing, invited\\nNell to come and sit beside her.', '‘Well, child,’ she said, ‘how do you like this way of travelling?’\\n\\nNell replied that she thought it was very pleasant indeed, to which the\\nlady assented in the case of people who had their spirits.', 'For\\nherself, she said, she was troubled with a lowness in that respect\\nwhich required a constant stimulant; though whether the aforesaid\\nstimulant was derived from the suspicious bottle of which mention has\\nbeen already made or from other sources, she did not say.', '‘That’s the happiness of you young people,’ she continued.', '‘You don’t\\nknow what it is to be low in your feelings.', 'You always have your\\nappetites too, and what a comfort that is.’\\n\\nNell thought that she could sometimes dispense with her own appetite\\nvery conveniently; and thought, moreover, that there was nothing either\\nin the lady’s personal appearance or in her manner of taking tea, to\\nlead to the conclusion that her natural relish for meat and drink had\\nat all failed her.', 'She silently assented, however, as in duty bound,\\nto what the lady had said, and waited until she should speak again.', 'Instead of speaking, however, she sat looking at the child for a long\\ntime in silence, and then getting up, brought out from a corner a large\\nroll of canvas about a yard in width, which she laid upon the floor and\\nspread open with her foot until it nearly reached from one end of the\\ncaravan to the other.', '‘There, child,’ she said, ‘read that.’\\n\\nNell walked down it, and read aloud, in enormous black letters, the\\ninscription, ‘JARLEY’S WAX-WORK.’\\n\\n‘Read it again,’ said the lady, complacently.', '‘Jarley’s Wax-Work,’ repeated Nell.', '‘That’s me,’ said the lady.', '‘I am Mrs Jarley.’\\n\\nGiving the child an encouraging look, intended to reassure her and let\\nher know, that, although she stood in the presence of the original\\nJarley, she must not allow herself to be utterly overwhelmed and borne\\ndown, the lady of the caravan unfolded another scroll, whereon was the\\ninscription, ‘One hundred figures the full size of life,’ and then\\nanother scroll, on which was written, ‘The only stupendous collection\\nof real wax-work in the world,’ and then several smaller scrolls with\\nsuch inscriptions as ‘Now exhibiting within’--‘The genuine and only\\nJarley’--‘Jarley’s unrivalled collection’--‘Jarley is the delight of\\nthe Nobility and Gentry’--‘The Royal Family are the patrons of Jarley.’\\nWhen she had exhibited these leviathans of public announcement to the\\nastonished child, she brought forth specimens of the lesser fry in the\\nshape of hand-bills, some of which were couched in the form of parodies\\non popular melodies, as ‘Believe me if all Jarley’s wax-work so\\nrare’--‘I saw thy show in youthful prime’--‘Over the water to Jarley;’\\nwhile, to consult all tastes, others were composed with a view to the\\nlighter and more facetious spirits, as a parody on the favourite air of\\n‘If I had a donkey,’ beginning,\\n\\n  If I know’d a donkey wot wouldn’t go\\n  To see Mrs JARLEY’S wax-work show,\\n  Do you think I’d acknowledge him?', 'Oh no no!', 'Then run to Jarley’s--\\n\\n--besides several compositions in prose, purporting to be dialogues\\nbetween the Emperor of China and an oyster, or the Archbishop of\\nCanterbury and a dissenter on the subject of church-rates, but all\\nhaving the same moral, namely, that the reader must make haste to\\nJarley’s, and that children and servants were admitted at half-price.', 'When she had brought all these testimonials of her important position\\nin society to bear upon her young companion, Mrs Jarley rolled them up,\\nand having put them carefully away, sat down again, and looked at the\\nchild in triumph.', '‘Never go into the company of a filthy Punch any more,’ said Mrs\\nJarley, ‘after this.’\\n\\n‘I never saw any wax-work, ma’am,’ said Nell.', '‘Is it funnier than\\nPunch?’\\n\\n‘Funnier!’ said Mrs Jarley in a shrill voice.', '‘It is not funny at all.’\\n\\n‘Oh!’ said Nell, with all possible humility.', '‘It isn’t funny at all,’ repeated Mrs Jarley.', '‘It’s calm and--what’s\\nthat word again--critical?--no--classical, that’s it--it’s calm and\\nclassical.', 'No low beatings and knockings about, no jokings and\\nsqueakings like your precious Punches, but always the same, with a\\nconstantly unchanging air of coldness and gentility; and so like life,\\nthat if wax-work only spoke and walked about, you’d hardly know the\\ndifference.', 'I won’t go so far as to say, that, as it is, I’ve seen\\nwax-work quite like life, but I’ve certainly seen some life that was\\nexactly like wax-work.’\\n\\n‘Is it here, ma’am?’ asked Nell, whose curiosity was awakened by this\\ndescription.', '‘Is what here, child?’\\n\\n‘The wax-work, ma’am.’\\n\\n‘Why, bless you, child, what are you thinking of?', 'How could such a\\ncollection be here, where you see everything except the inside of one\\nlittle cupboard and a few boxes?', 'It’s gone on in the other wans to the\\nassembly-rooms, and there it’ll be exhibited the day after to-morrow.', 'You are going to the same town, and you’ll see it I dare say.', 'It’s\\nnatural to expect that you’ll see it, and I’ve no doubt you will.', 'I\\nsuppose you couldn’t stop away if you was to try ever so much.’\\n\\n‘I shall not be in the town, I think, ma’am,’ said the child.', '‘Not there!’ cried Mrs Jarley.', '‘Then where will you be?’\\n\\n‘I--I--don’t quite know.', 'I am not certain.’\\n\\n‘You don’t mean to say that you’re travelling about the country without\\nknowing where you’re going to?’ said the lady of the caravan.', '‘What\\ncurious people you are!', 'What line are you in?', 'You looked to me at the\\nraces, child, as if you were quite out of your element, and had got\\nthere by accident.’\\n\\n‘We were there quite by accident,’ returned Nell, confused by this\\nabrupt questioning.', '‘We are poor people, ma’am, and are only wandering\\nabout.', 'We have nothing to do;--I wish we had.’\\n\\n‘You amaze me more and more,’ said Mrs Jarley, after remaining for some\\ntime as mute as one of her own figures.', '‘Why, what do you call\\nyourselves?', 'Not beggars?’\\n\\n‘Indeed, ma’am, I don’t know what else we are,’ returned the child.', '‘Lord bless me,’ said the lady of the caravan.', '‘I never heard of such\\na thing.', 'Who’d have thought it!’\\n\\nShe remained so long silent after this exclamation, that Nell feared\\nshe felt her having been induced to bestow her protection and\\nconversation upon one so poor, to be an outrage upon her dignity that\\nnothing could repair.', 'This persuasion was rather confirmed than\\notherwise by the tone in which she at length broke silence and said,\\n\\n‘And yet you can read.', 'And write too, I shouldn’t wonder?’\\n\\n‘Yes, ma’am,’ said the child, fearful of giving new offence by the\\nconfession.', '‘Well, and what a thing that is,’ returned Mrs Jarley.', '‘I can’t!’\\n\\nNell said ‘indeed’ in a tone which might imply, either that she was\\nreasonably surprised to find the genuine and only Jarley, who was the\\ndelight of the Nobility and Gentry and the peculiar pet of the Royal\\nFamily, destitute of these familiar arts; or that she presumed so great\\na lady could scarcely stand in need of such ordinary accomplishments.', 'In whatever way Mrs Jarley received the response, it did not provoke\\nher to further questioning, or tempt her into any more remarks at the\\ntime, for she relapsed into a thoughtful silence, and remained in that\\nstate so long that Nell withdrew to the other window and rejoined her\\ngrandfather, who was now awake.', 'At length the lady of the caravan shook off her fit of meditation, and,\\nsummoning the driver to come under the window at which she was seated,\\nheld a long conversation with him in a low tone of voice, as if she\\nwere asking his advice on an important point, and discussing the pros\\nand cons of some very weighty matter.', 'This conference at length\\nconcluded, she drew in her head again, and beckoned Nell to approach.', '‘And the old gentleman too,’ said Mrs Jarley; ‘for I want to have a\\nword with him.', 'Do you want a good situation for your grand-daughter,\\nmaster?', 'If you do, I can put her in the way of getting one.', 'What do\\nyou say?’\\n\\n‘I can’t leave her,’ answered the old man.', '‘We can’t separate.', 'What\\nwould become of me without her?’\\n\\n‘I should have thought you were old enough to take care of yourself, if\\nyou ever will be,’ retorted Mrs Jarley sharply.', '‘But he never will be,’ said the child in an earnest whisper.', '‘I fear\\nhe never will be again.', 'Pray do not speak harshly to him.', 'We are very\\nthankful to you,’ she added aloud; ‘but neither of us could part from\\nthe other if all the wealth of the world were halved between us.’\\n\\nMrs Jarley was a little disconcerted by this reception of her proposal,\\nand looked at the old man, who tenderly took Nell’s hand and detained\\nit in his own, as if she could have very well dispensed with his\\ncompany or even his earthly existence.', 'After an awkward pause, she\\nthrust her head out of the window again, and had another conference\\nwith the driver upon some point on which they did not seem to agree\\nquite so readily as on their former topic of discussion; but they\\nconcluded at last, and she addressed the grandfather again.', '‘If you’re really disposed to employ yourself,’ said Mrs Jarley, ‘there\\nwould be plenty for you to do in the way of helping to dust the\\nfigures, and take the checks, and so forth.', 'What I want your\\ngrand-daughter for, is to point ‘em out to the company; they would be\\nsoon learnt, and she has a way with her that people wouldn’t think\\nunpleasant, though she does come after me; for I’ve been always\\naccustomed to go round with visitors myself, which I should keep on\\ndoing now, only that my spirits make a little ease absolutely\\nnecessary.', 'It’s not a common offer, bear in mind,’ said the lady,\\nrising into the tone and manner in which she was accustomed to address\\nher audiences; ‘it’s Jarley’s wax-work, remember.', 'The duty’s very\\nlight and genteel, the company particularly select, the exhibition\\ntakes place in assembly-rooms, town-halls, large rooms at inns, or\\nauction galleries.', 'There is none of your open-air wagrancy at\\nJarley’s, recollect; there is no tarpaulin and sawdust at Jarley’s,\\nremember.', 'Every expectation held out in the handbills is realised to\\nthe utmost, and the whole forms an effect of imposing brilliancy\\nhitherto unrivalled in this kingdom.', 'Remember that the price of\\nadmission is only sixpence, and that this is an opportunity which may\\nnever occur again!’\\n\\nDescending from the sublime when she had reached this point, to the\\ndetails of common life, Mrs Jarley remarked that with reference to\\nsalary she could pledge herself to no specific sum until she had\\nsufficiently tested Nell’s abilities, and narrowly watched her in the\\nperformance of her duties.', 'But board and lodging, both for her and her\\ngrandfather, she bound herself to provide, and she furthermore passed\\nher word that the board should always be good in quality, and in\\nquantity plentiful.', 'Nell and her grandfather consulted together, and while they were so\\nengaged, Mrs Jarley with her hands behind her walked up and down the\\ncaravan, as she had walked after tea on the dull earth, with uncommon\\ndignity and self-esteem.', 'Nor will this appear so slight a circumstance\\nas to be unworthy of mention, when it is remembered that the caravan\\nwas in uneasy motion all the time, and that none but a person of great\\nnatural stateliness and acquired grace could have forborne to stagger.', '‘Now, child?’ cried Mrs Jarley, coming to a halt as Nell turned towards\\nher.', '‘We are very much obliged to you, ma’am,’ said Nell, ‘and thankfully\\naccept your offer.’\\n\\n‘And you’ll never be sorry for it,’ returned Mrs Jarley.', '‘I’m pretty\\nsure of that.', 'So as that’s all settled, let us have a bit of supper.’\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the caravan blundered on as if it too had been\\ndrinking strong beer and was drowsy, and came at last upon the paved\\nstreets of a town which were clear of passengers, and quiet, for it was\\nby this time near midnight, and the townspeople were all abed.', 'As it\\nwas too late an hour to repair to the exhibition room, they turned\\naside into a piece of waste ground that lay just within the old\\ntown-gate, and drew up there for the night, near to another caravan,\\nwhich, notwithstanding that it bore on the lawful panel the great name\\nof Jarley, and was employed besides in conveying from place to place\\nthe wax-work which was its country’s pride, was designated by a\\ngrovelling stamp-office as a ‘Common Stage Waggon,’ and numbered\\ntoo--seven thousand odd hundred--as though its precious freight were\\nmere flour or coals!', 'This ill-used machine being empty (for it had deposited its burden at\\nthe place of exhibition, and lingered here until its services were\\nagain required) was assigned to the old man as his sleeping-place for\\nthe night; and within its wooden walls, Nell made him up the best bed\\nshe could, from the materials at hand.', 'For herself, she was to sleep\\nin Mrs Jarley’s own travelling-carriage, as a signal mark of that\\nlady’s favour and confidence.', 'She had taken leave of her grandfather and was returning to the other\\nwaggon, when she was tempted by the coolness of the night to linger for\\na little while in the air.', 'The moon was shining down upon the old\\ngateway of the town, leaving the low archway very black and dark; and\\nwith a mingled sensation of curiosity and fear, she slowly approached\\nthe gate, and stood still to look up at it, wondering to see how dark,\\nand grim, and old, and cold, it looked.', 'There was an empty niche from which some old statue had fallen or been\\ncarried away hundreds of years ago, and she was thinking what strange\\npeople it must have looked down upon when it stood there, and how many\\nhard struggles might have taken place, and how many murders might have\\nbeen done, upon that silent spot, when there suddenly emerged from the\\nblack shade of the arch, a man.', 'The instant he appeared, she\\nrecognised him--Who could have failed to recognise, in that instant,\\nthe ugly misshapen Quilp!', 'The street beyond was so narrow, and the shadow of the houses on one\\nside of the way so deep, that he seemed to have risen out of the earth.', 'But there he was.', 'The child withdrew into a dark corner, and saw him\\npass close to her.', 'He had a stick in his hand, and, when he had got\\nclear of the shadow of the gateway, he leant upon it, looked\\nback--directly, as it seemed, towards where she stood--and beckoned.', 'To her?', 'oh no, thank God, not to her; for as she stood, in an\\nextremity of fear, hesitating whether to scream for help, or come from\\nher hiding-place and fly, before he should draw nearer, there issued\\nslowly forth from the arch another figure--that of a boy--who carried\\non his back a trunk.', '‘Faster, sirrah!’ cried Quilp, looking up at the old gateway, and\\nshowing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down\\nfrom its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house,\\n‘faster!’\\n\\n‘It’s a dreadful heavy load, Sir,’ the boy pleaded.', '‘I’ve come on very\\nfast, considering.’\\n\\n‘_You_ have come fast, considering!’ retorted Quilp; ‘you creep, you dog,\\nyou crawl, you measure distance like a worm.', 'There are the chimes now,\\nhalf-past twelve.’\\n\\nHe stopped to listen, and then turning upon the boy with a suddenness\\nand ferocity that made him start, asked at what hour that London coach\\npassed the corner of the road.', 'The boy replied, at one.', '‘Come on then,’ said Quilp, ‘or I shall be too late.', 'Faster--do you\\nhear me?', 'Faster.’\\n\\nThe boy made all the speed he could, and Quilp led onward, constantly\\nturning back to threaten him, and urge him to greater haste.', 'Nell did\\nnot dare to move until they were out of sight and hearing, and then\\nhurried to where she had left her grandfather, feeling as if the very\\npassing of the dwarf so near him must have filled him with alarm and\\nterror.', 'But he was sleeping soundly, and she softly withdrew.', 'As she was making her way to her own bed, she determined to say nothing\\nof this adventure, as upon whatever errand the dwarf had come (and she\\nfeared it must have been in search of them) it was clear by his inquiry\\nabout the London coach that he was on his way homeward, and as he had\\npassed through that place, it was but reasonable to suppose that they\\nwere safer from his inquiries there, than they could be elsewhere.', 'These reflections did not remove her own alarm, for she had been too\\nmuch terrified to be easily composed, and felt as if she were hemmed in\\nby a legion of Quilps, and the very air itself were filled with them.', 'The delight of the Nobility and Gentry and the patronised of Royalty\\nhad, by some process of self-abridgment known only to herself, got into\\nher travelling bed, where she was snoring peacefully, while the large\\nbonnet, carefully disposed upon the drum, was revealing its glories by\\nthe light of a dim lamp that swung from the roof.', 'The child’s bed was\\nalready made upon the floor, and it was a great comfort to her to hear\\nthe steps removed as soon as she had entered, and to know that all easy\\ncommunication between persons outside and the brass knocker was by this\\nmeans effectually prevented.', 'Certain guttural sounds, too, which from\\ntime to time ascended through the floor of the caravan, and a rustling\\nof straw in the same direction, apprised her that the driver was\\ncouched upon the ground beneath, and gave her an additional feeling of\\nsecurity.', 'Notwithstanding these protections, she could get none but broken sleep\\nby fits and starts all night, for fear of Quilp, who throughout her\\nuneasy dreams was somehow connected with the wax-work, or was wax-work\\nhimself, or was Mrs Jarley and wax-work too, or was himself, Mrs\\nJarley, wax-work, and a barrel organ all in one, and yet not exactly\\nany of them either.', 'At length, towards break of day, that deep sleep\\ncame upon her which succeeds to weariness and over-watching, and which\\nhas no consciousness but one of overpowering and irresistible enjoyment.', 'CHAPTER 28\\n\\nSleep hung upon the eyelids of the child so long, that, when she awoke,\\nMrs Jarley was already decorated with her large bonnet, and actively\\nengaged in preparing breakfast.', 'She received Nell’s apology for being\\nso late with perfect good humour, and said that she should not have\\nroused her if she had slept on until noon.', '‘Because it does you good,’ said the lady of the caravan, ‘when you’re\\ntired, to sleep as long as ever you can, and get the fatigue quite off;\\nand that’s another blessing of your time of life--you can sleep so very\\nsound.’\\n\\n‘Have you had a bad night, ma’am?’ asked Nell.', '‘I seldom have anything else, child,’ replied Mrs Jarley, with the air\\nof a martyr.', '‘I sometimes wonder how I bear it.’\\n\\nRemembering the snores which had proceeded from that cleft in the\\ncaravan in which the proprietress of the wax-work passed the night,\\nNell rather thought she must have been dreaming of lying awake.', 'However, she expressed herself very sorry to hear such a dismal account\\nof her state of health, and shortly afterwards sat down with her\\ngrandfather and Mrs Jarley to breakfast.', 'The meal finished, Nell\\nassisted to wash the cups and saucers, and put them in their proper\\nplaces, and these household duties performed, Mrs Jarley arrayed\\nherself in an exceedingly bright shawl for the purpose of making a\\nprogress through the streets of the town.', '‘The wan will come on to bring the boxes,’ said Mrs Jarley, and you had\\nbetter come in it, child.', 'I am obliged to walk, very much against my\\nwill; but the people expect it of me, and public characters can’t be\\ntheir own masters and mistresses in such matters as these.', 'How do I\\nlook, child?’\\n\\nNell returned a satisfactory reply, and Mrs Jarley, after sticking a\\ngreat many pins into various parts of her figure, and making several\\nabortive attempts to obtain a full view of her own back, was at last\\nsatisfied with her appearance, and went forth majestically.', 'The caravan followed at no great distance.', 'As it went jolting through\\nthe streets, Nell peeped from the window, curious to see in what kind\\nof place they were, and yet fearful of encountering at every turn the\\ndreaded face of Quilp.', 'It was a pretty large town, with an open square\\nwhich they were crawling slowly across, and in the middle of which was\\nthe Town-Hall, with a clock-tower and a weather-cock.', 'There were\\nhouses of stone, houses of red brick, houses of yellow brick, houses of\\nlath and plaster; and houses of wood, many of them very old, with\\nwithered faces carved upon the beams, and staring down into the street.', 'These had very little winking windows, and low-arched doors, and, in\\nsome of the narrower ways, quite overhung the pavement.', 'The streets\\nwere very clean, very sunny, very empty, and very dull.', 'A few idle men\\nlounged about the two inns, and the empty market-place, and the\\ntradesmen’s doors, and some old people were dozing in chairs outside an\\nalms-house wall; but scarcely any passengers who seemed bent on going\\nanywhere, or to have any object in view, went by; and if perchance some\\nstraggler did, his footsteps echoed on the hot bright pavement for\\nminutes afterwards.', 'Nothing seemed to be going on but the clocks, and\\nthey had such drowzy faces, such heavy lazy hands, and such cracked\\nvoices that they surely must have been too slow.', 'The very dogs were\\nall asleep, and the flies, drunk with moist sugar in the grocer’s shop,\\nforgot their wings and briskness, and baked to death in dusty corners\\nof the window.', 'Rumbling along with most unwonted noise, the caravan stopped at last at\\nthe place of exhibition, where Nell dismounted amidst an admiring group\\nof children, who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the\\ncuriosities, and were fully impressed with the belief that her\\ngrandfather was a cunning device in wax.', 'The chests were taken out\\nwith all convenient despatch, and taken in to be unlocked by Mrs\\nJarley, who, attended by George and another man in velveteen shorts and\\na drab hat ornamented with turnpike tickets, were waiting to dispose\\ntheir contents (consisting of red festoons and other ornamental devices\\nin upholstery work) to the best advantage in the decoration of the room.', 'They all got to work without loss of time, and very busy they were.', 'As\\nthe stupendous collection were yet concealed by cloths, lest the\\nenvious dust should injure their complexions, Nell bestirred herself to\\nassist in the embellishment of the room, in which her grandfather also\\nwas of great service.', 'The two men being well used to it, did a great\\ndeal in a short time; and Mrs Jarley served out the tin tacks from a\\nlinen pocket like a toll-collector’s which she wore for the purpose,\\nand encouraged her assistants to renewed exertion.', 'While they were thus employed, a tallish gentleman with a hook nose and\\nblack hair, dressed in a military surtout very short and tight in the\\nsleeves, and which had once been frogged and braided all over, but was\\nnow sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbare--dressed too in\\nancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg, and a pair of pumps\\nin the winter of their existence--looked in at the door and smiled\\naffably.', 'Mrs Jarley’s back being then towards him, the military\\ngentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to\\napprise her of his presence, and stealing up close behind her, tapped\\nher on the neck, and cried playfully ‘Boh!’\\n\\n‘What, Mr Slum!’ cried the lady of the wax-work.', '‘Lot!', 'who’d have\\nthought of seeing you here!’\\n\\n‘’Pon my soul and honour,’ said Mr Slum, ‘that’s a good remark.', '‘Pon\\nmy soul and honour that’s a wise remark.', 'Who would have thought it!', 'George, my faithful feller, how are you?’\\n\\nGeorge received this advance with a surly indifference, observing that\\nhe was well enough for the matter of that, and hammering lustily all\\nthe time.', '‘I came here,’ said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley--‘’pon\\nmy soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for.', 'It would\\npuzzle me to tell you, it would by Gad.', 'I wanted a little inspiration,\\na little freshening up, a little change of ideas, and-- ‘Pon my soul\\nand honour,’ said the military gentleman, checking himself and looking\\nround the room, ‘what a devilish classical thing this is!', 'by Gad, it’s\\nquite Minervian.’\\n\\n‘It’ll look well enough when it comes to be finished,’ observed Mrs\\nJarley.', '‘Well enough!’ said Mr Slum.', '‘Will you believe me when I say it’s the\\ndelight of my life to have dabbled in poetry, when I think I’ve\\nexercised my pen upon this charming theme?', 'By the way--any orders?', 'Is\\nthere any little thing I can do for you?’\\n\\n‘It comes so very expensive, sir,’ replied Mrs Jarley, ‘and I really\\ndon’t think it does much good.’\\n\\n‘Hush!', 'No, no!’ returned Mr Slum, elevating his hand.', '‘No fibs.', 'I’ll\\nnot hear it.', 'Don’t say it don’t do good.', 'Don’t say it.', 'I know\\nbetter!’\\n\\n‘I don’t think it does,’ said Mrs Jarley.', '‘Ha, ha!’ cried Mr Slum, ‘you’re giving way, you’re coming down.', 'Ask\\nthe perfumers, ask the blacking-makers, ask the hatters, ask the old\\nlottery-office-keepers--ask any man among ‘em what my poetry has done\\nfor him, and mark my words, he blesses the name of Slum.', 'If he’s an\\nhonest man, he raises his eyes to heaven, and blesses the name of\\nSlum--mark that!', 'You are acquainted with Westminster Abbey, Mrs\\nJarley?’\\n\\n‘Yes, surely.’\\n\\n‘Then upon my soul and honour, ma’am, you’ll find in a certain angle of\\nthat dreary pile, called Poets’ Corner, a few smaller names than Slum,’\\nretorted that gentleman, tapping himself expressively on the forehead\\nto imply that there was some slight quantity of brain behind it.', '‘I’ve\\ngot a little trifle here, now,’ said Mr Slum, taking off his hat which\\nwas full of scraps of paper, ‘a little trifle here, thrown off in the\\nheat of the moment, which I should say was exactly the thing you wanted\\nto set this place on fire with.', 'It’s an acrostic--the name at this\\nmoment is Warren, and the idea’s a convertible one, and a positive\\ninspiration for Jarley.', 'Have the acrostic.’\\n\\n‘I suppose it’s very dear,’ said Mrs Jarley.', '‘Five shillings,’ returned Mr Slum, using his pencil as a toothpick.', '‘Cheaper than any prose.’\\n\\n‘I couldn’t give more than three,’ said Mrs Jarley.', '‘--And six,’ retorted Slum.', '‘Come.', 'Three-and-six.’\\n\\nMrs Jarley was not proof against the poet’s insinuating manner, and Mr\\nSlum entered the order in a small note-book as a three-and-sixpenny\\none.', 'Mr Slum then withdrew to alter the acrostic, after taking a most\\naffectionate leave of his patroness, and promising to return, as soon\\nas he possibly could, with a fair copy for the printer.', 'As his presence had not interfered with or interrupted the\\npreparations, they were now far advanced, and were completed shortly\\nafter his departure.', 'When the festoons were all put up as tastily as\\nthey might be, the stupendous collection was uncovered, and there were\\ndisplayed, on a raised platform some two feet from the floor, running\\nround the room and parted from the rude public by a crimson rope breast\\nhigh, divers sprightly effigies of celebrated characters, singly and in\\ngroups, clad in glittering dresses of various climes and times, and\\nstanding more or less unsteadily upon their legs, with their eyes very\\nwide open, and their nostrils very much inflated, and the muscles of\\ntheir legs and arms very strongly developed, and all their countenances\\nexpressing great surprise.', 'All the gentlemen were very pigeon-breasted\\nand very blue about the beards; and all the ladies were miraculous\\nfigures; and all the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking\\nintensely nowhere, and staring with extraordinary earnestness at\\nnothing.', 'When Nell had exhausted her first raptures at this glorious sight, Mrs\\nJarley ordered the room to be cleared of all but herself and the child,\\nand, sitting herself down in an arm-chair in the centre, formally\\ninvested Nell with a willow wand, long used by herself for pointing out\\nthe characters, and was at great pains to instruct her in her duty.', '‘That,’ said Mrs Jarley in her exhibition tone, as Nell touched a\\nfigure at the beginning of the platform, ‘is an unfortunate Maid of\\nHonour in the Time of Queen Elizabeth, who died from pricking her\\nfinger in consequence of working upon a Sunday.', 'Observe the blood\\nwhich is trickling from her finger; also the gold-eyed needle of the\\nperiod, with which she is at work.’\\n\\nAll this, Nell repeated twice or thrice: pointing to the finger and the\\nneedle at the right times: and then passed on to the next.', '‘That, ladies and gentlemen,’ said Mrs Jarley, ‘is Jasper Packlemerton\\nof atrocious memory, who courted and married fourteen wives, and\\ndestroyed them all, by tickling the soles of their feet when they were\\nsleeping in the consciousness of innocence and virtue.', 'On being\\nbrought to the scaffold and asked if he was sorry for what he had done,\\nhe replied yes, he was sorry for having let ‘em off so easy, and hoped\\nall Christian husbands would pardon him the offence.', 'Let this be a\\nwarning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the\\ngentlemen of their choice.', 'Observe that his fingers are curled as if\\nin the act of tickling, and that his face is represented with a wink,\\nas he appeared when committing his barbarous murders.’\\n\\nWhen Nell knew all about Mr Packlemerton, and could say it without\\nfaltering, Mrs Jarley passed on to the fat man, and then to the thin\\nman, the tall man, the short man, the old lady who died of dancing at a\\nhundred and thirty-two, the wild boy of the woods, the woman who\\npoisoned fourteen families with pickled walnuts, and other historical\\ncharacters and interesting but misguided individuals.', 'And so well did\\nNell profit by her instructions, and so apt was she to remember them,\\nthat by the time they had been shut up together for a couple of hours,\\nshe was in full possession of the history of the whole establishment,\\nand perfectly competent to the enlightenment of visitors.', 'Mrs Jarley was not slow to express her admiration at this happy result,\\nand carried her young friend and pupil to inspect the remaining\\narrangements within doors, by virtue of which the passage had been\\nalready converted into a grove of green-baize hung with the inscription\\nshe had already seen (Mr Slum’s productions), and a highly ornamented\\ntable placed at the upper end for Mrs Jarley herself, at which she was\\nto preside and take the money, in company with his Majesty King George\\nthe Third, Mr Grimaldi as clown, Mary Queen of Scots, an anonymous\\ngentleman of the Quaker persuasion, and Mr Pitt holding in his hand a\\ncorrect model of the bill for the imposition of the window duty.', 'The\\npreparations without doors had not been neglected either; a nun of\\ngreat personal attractions was telling her beads on the little portico\\nover the door; and a brigand with the blackest possible head of hair,\\nand the clearest possible complexion, was at that moment going round\\nthe town in a cart, consulting the miniature of a lady.', 'It now only remained that Mr Slum’s compositions should be judiciously\\ndistributed; that the pathetic effusions should find their way to all\\nprivate houses and tradespeople; and that the parody commencing ‘If I\\nknow’d a donkey,’ should be confined to the taverns, and circulated\\nonly among the lawyers’ clerks and choice spirits of the place.', 'When\\nthis had been done, and Mrs Jarley had waited upon the boarding-schools\\nin person, with a handbill composed expressly for them, in which it was\\ndistinctly proved that wax-work refined the mind, cultivated the taste,\\nand enlarged the sphere of the human understanding, that indefatigable\\nlady sat down to dinner, and drank out of the suspicious bottle to a\\nflourishing campaign.', 'CHAPTER 29\\n\\nUnquestionably Mrs Jarley had an inventive genius.', 'In the midst of the\\nvarious devices for attracting visitors to the exhibition, little Nell\\nwas not forgotten.', 'The light cart in which the Brigand usually made\\nhis perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers, and\\nthe Brigand placed therein, contemplating the miniature of his beloved\\nas usual, Nell was accommodated with a seat beside him, decorated with\\nartificial flowers, and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through\\nthe town every morning, dispersing handbills from a basket, to the\\nsound of drum and trumpet.', 'The beauty of the child, coupled with her\\ngentle and timid bearing, produced quite a sensation in the little\\ncountry place.', 'The Brigand, heretofore a source of exclusive interest\\nin the streets, became a mere secondary consideration, and to be\\nimportant only as a part of the show of which she was the chief\\nattraction.', 'Grown-up folks began to be interested in the bright-eyed\\ngirl, and some score of little boys fell desperately in love, and\\nconstantly left enclosures of nuts and apples, directed in small-text,\\nat the wax-work door.', 'This desirable impression was not lost on Mrs Jarley, who, lest Nell\\nshould become too cheap, soon sent the Brigand out alone again, and\\nkept her in the exhibition room, where she described the figures every\\nhalf-hour to the great satisfaction of admiring audiences.', 'And these\\naudiences were of a very superior description, including a great many\\nyoung ladies’ boarding-schools, whose favour Mrs Jarley had been at\\ngreat pains to conciliate, by altering the face and costume of Mr\\nGrimaldi as clown to represent Mr Lindley Murray as he appeared when\\nengaged in the composition of his English Grammar, and turning a\\nmurderess of great renown into Mrs Hannah More--both of which\\nlikenesses were admitted by Miss Monflathers, who was at the head of\\nthe head Boarding and Day Establishment in the town, and who\\ncondescended to take a Private View with eight chosen young ladies, to\\nbe quite startling from their extreme correctness.', 'Mr Pitt in a\\nnightcap and bedgown, and without his boots, represented the poet\\nCowper with perfect exactness; and Mary Queen of Scots in a dark wig,\\nwhite shirt-collar, and male attire, was such a complete image of Lord\\nByron that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it.', 'Miss\\nMonflathers, however, rebuked this enthusiasm, and took occasion to\\nreprove Mrs Jarley for not keeping her collection more select:\\nobserving that His Lordship had held certain opinions quite\\nincompatible with wax-work honours, and adding something about a Dean\\nand Chapter, which Mrs Jarley did not understand.', 'Although her duties were sufficiently laborious, Nell found in the lady\\nof the caravan a very kind and considerate person, who had not only a\\npeculiar relish for being comfortable herself, but for making everybody\\nabout her comfortable also; which latter taste, it may be remarked, is,\\neven in persons who live in much finer places than caravans, a far more\\nrare and uncommon one than the first, and is not by any means its\\nnecessary consequence.', 'As her popularity procured her various little\\nfees from the visitors on which her patroness never demanded any toll,\\nand as her grandfather too was well-treated and useful, she had no\\ncause of anxiety in connexion with the wax-work, beyond that which\\nsprung from her recollection of Quilp, and her fears that he might\\nreturn and one day suddenly encounter them.', 'Quilp indeed was a perpetual night-mare to the child, who was\\nconstantly haunted by a vision of his ugly face and stunted figure.', 'She slept, for their better security, in the room where the wax-work\\nfigures were, and she never retired to this place at night but she\\ntortured herself--she could not help it--with imagining a resemblance,\\nin some one or other of their death-like faces, to the dwarf, and this\\nfancy would sometimes so gain upon her that she would almost believe he\\nhad removed the figure and stood within the clothes.', 'Then there were\\nso many of them with their great glassy eyes--and, as they stood one\\nbehind the other all about her bed, they looked so like living\\ncreatures, and yet so unlike in their grim stillness and silence, that\\nshe had a kind of terror of them for their own sakes, and would often\\nlie watching their dusky figures until she was obliged to rise and\\nlight a candle, or go and sit at the open window and feel a\\ncompanionship in the bright stars.', 'At these times, she would recall\\nthe old house and the window at which she used to sit alone; and then\\nshe would think of poor Kit and all his kindness, until the tears came\\ninto her eyes, and she would weep and smile together.', 'Often and anxiously at this silent hour, her thoughts reverted to her\\ngrandfather, and she would wonder how much he remembered of their\\nformer life, and whether he was ever really mindful of the change in\\ntheir condition and of their late helplessness and destitution.', 'When\\nthey were wandering about, she seldom thought of this, but now she\\ncould not help considering what would become of them if he fell sick,\\nor her own strength were to fail her.', 'He was very patient and willing,\\nhappy to execute any little task, and glad to be of use; but he was in\\nthe same listless state, with no prospect of improvement--a mere\\nchild--a poor, thoughtless, vacant creature--a harmless fond old man,\\nsusceptible of tender love and regard for her, and of pleasant and\\npainful impressions, but alive to nothing more.', 'It made her very sad\\nto know that this was so--so sad to see it that sometimes when he sat\\nidly by, smiling and nodding to her when she looked round, or when he\\ncaressed some little child and carried it to and fro, as he was fond of\\ndoing by the hour together, perplexed by its simple questions, yet\\npatient under his own infirmity, and seeming almost conscious of it\\ntoo, and humbled even before the mind of an infant--so sad it made her\\nto see him thus, that she would burst into tears, and, withdrawing into\\nsome secret place, fall down upon her knees and pray that he might be\\nrestored.', 'But, the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this\\ncondition, when he was at least content and tranquil, nor in her\\nsolitary meditations on his altered state, though these were trials for\\na young heart.', 'Cause for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come.', 'One evening, a holiday night with them, Nell and her grandfather went\\nout to walk.', 'They had been rather closely confined for some days, and\\nthe weather being warm, they strolled a long distance.', 'Clear of the\\ntown, they took a footpath which struck through some pleasant fields,\\njudging that it would terminate in the road they quitted and enable\\nthem to return that way.', 'It made, however, a much wider circuit than\\nthey had supposed, and thus they were tempted onward until sunset, when\\nthey reached the track of which they were in search, and stopped to\\nrest.', 'It had been gradually getting overcast, and now the sky was dark and\\nlowering, save where the glory of the departing sun piled up masses of\\ngold and burning fire, decaying embers of which gleamed here and there\\nthrough the black veil, and shone redly down upon the earth.', 'The wind\\nbegan to moan in hollow murmurs, as the sun went down carrying glad day\\nelsewhere; and a train of dull clouds coming up against it, menaced\\nthunder and lightning.', 'Large drops of rain soon began to fall, and, as\\nthe storm clouds came sailing onward, others supplied the void they\\nleft behind and spread over all the sky.', 'Then was heard the low\\nrumbling of distant thunder, then the lightning quivered, and then the\\ndarkness of an hour seemed to have gathered in an instant.', 'Fearful of taking shelter beneath a tree or hedge, the old man and the\\nchild hurried along the high road, hoping to find some house in which\\nthey could seek a refuge from the storm, which had now burst forth in\\nearnest, and every moment increased in violence.', 'Drenched with the\\npelting rain, confused by the deafening thunder, and bewildered by the\\nglare of the forked lightning, they would have passed a solitary house\\nwithout being aware of its vicinity, had not a man, who was standing at\\nthe door, called lustily to them to enter.', '‘Your ears ought to be better than other folks’ at any rate, if you\\nmake so little of the chance of being struck blind,’ he said,\\nretreating from the door and shading his eyes with his hands as the\\njagged lightning came again.', '‘What were you going past for, eh?’ he\\nadded, as he closed the door and led the way along a passage to a room\\nbehind.', '‘We didn’t see the house, sir, till we heard you calling,’ Nell replied.', '‘No wonder,’ said the man, ‘with this lightning in one’s eyes,\\nby-the-by.', 'You had better stand by the fire here, and dry yourselves a\\nbit.', 'You can call for what you like if you want anything.', 'If you\\ndon’t want anything, you are not obliged to give an order.', 'Don’t be\\nafraid of that.', 'This is a public-house, that’s all.', 'The Valiant\\nSoldier is pretty well known hereabouts.’\\n\\n‘Is this house called the Valiant Soldier, Sir?’ asked Nell.', '‘I thought everybody knew that,’ replied the landlord.', '‘Where have you\\ncome from, if you don’t know the Valiant Soldier as well as the church\\ncatechism?', 'This is the Valiant Soldier, by James Groves--Jem\\nGroves--honest Jem Groves, as is a man of unblemished moral character,\\nand has a good dry skittle-ground.', 'If any man has got anything to say\\nagain Jem Groves, let him say it TO Jem Groves, and Jem Groves can\\naccommodate him with a customer on any terms from four pound a side to\\nforty.', 'With these words, the speaker tapped himself on the waistcoat to\\nintimate that he was the Jem Groves so highly eulogized; sparred\\nscientifically at a counterfeit Jem Groves, who was sparring at society\\nin general from a black frame over the chimney-piece; and, applying a\\nhalf-emptied glass of spirits and water to his lips, drank Jem Groves’s\\nhealth.', 'The night being warm, there was a large screen drawn across the room,\\nfor a barrier against the heat of the fire.', 'It seemed as if somebody\\non the other side of this screen had been insinuating doubts of Mr\\nGroves’s prowess, and had thereby given rise to these egotistical\\nexpressions, for Mr Groves wound up his defiance by giving a loud knock\\nupon it with his knuckles and pausing for a reply from the other side.', '‘There an’t many men,’ said Mr Groves, no answer being returned, ‘who\\nwould ventur’ to cross Jem Groves under his own roof.', 'There’s only one\\nman, I know, that has nerve enough for that, and that man’s not a\\nhundred mile from here neither.', 'But he’s worth a dozen men, and I let\\nhim say of me whatever he likes in consequence--he knows that.’\\n\\nIn return for this complimentary address, a very gruff hoarse voice\\nbade Mr Groves ‘hold his noise and light a candle.’  And the same voice\\nremarked that the same gentleman ‘needn’t waste his breath in brag, for\\nmost people knew pretty well what sort of stuff he was made of.’\\n\\n‘Nell, they’re--they’re playing cards,’ whispered the old man, suddenly\\ninterested.', '‘Don’t you hear them?’\\n\\n‘Look sharp with that candle,’ said the voice; ‘it’s as much as I can\\ndo to see the pips on the cards as it is; and get this shutter closed\\nas quick as you can, will you?', 'Your beer will be the worse for\\nto-night’s thunder I expect.--Game!', 'Seven-and-sixpence to me, old\\nIsaac.', 'Hand over.’\\n\\n‘Do you hear, Nell, do you hear them?’ whispered the old man again,\\nwith increased earnestness, as the money chinked upon the table.', '‘I haven’t seen such a storm as this,’ said a sharp cracked voice of\\nmost disagreeable quality, when a tremendous peal of thunder had died\\naway, ‘since the night when old Luke Withers won thirteen times running\\non the red.', 'We all said he had the Devil’s luck and his own, and as it\\nwas the kind of night for the Devil to be out and busy, I suppose he\\nwas looking over his shoulder, if anybody could have seen him.’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ returned the gruff voice; ‘for all old Luke’s winning through\\nthick and thin of late years, I remember the time when he was the\\nunluckiest and unfortunatest of men.', 'He never took a dice-box in his\\nhand, or held a card, but he was plucked, pigeoned, and cleaned out\\ncompletely.’\\n\\n‘Do you hear what he says?’ whispered the old man.', '‘Do you hear that,\\nNell?’\\n\\nThe child saw with astonishment and alarm that his whole appearance had\\nundergone a complete change.', 'His face was flushed and eager, his eyes\\nwere strained, his teeth set, his breath came short and thick, and the\\nhand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that she shook beneath\\nits grasp.', '‘Bear witness,’ he muttered, looking upward, ‘that I always said it;\\nthat I knew it, dreamed of it, felt it was the truth, and that it must\\nbe so!', 'What money have we, Nell?', 'Come!', 'I saw you with money\\nyesterday.', 'What money have we?', 'Give it to me.’\\n\\n‘No, no, let me keep it, grandfather,’ said the frightened child.', '‘Let\\nus go away from here.', 'Do not mind the rain.', 'Pray let us go.’\\n\\n‘Give it to me, I say,’ returned the old man fiercely.', '‘Hush, hush,\\ndon’t cry, Nell.', 'If I spoke sharply, dear, I didn’t mean it.', 'It’s for\\nthy good.', 'I have wronged thee, Nell, but I will right thee yet, I will\\nindeed.', 'Where is the money?’\\n\\n‘Do not take it,’ said the child.', '‘Pray do not take it, dear.', 'For\\nboth our sakes let me keep it, or let me throw it away--better let me\\nthrow it away, than you take it now.', 'Let us go; do let us go.’\\n\\n‘Give me the money,’ returned the old man, ‘I must have it.', 'There--there--that’s my dear Nell.', 'I’ll right thee one day, child,\\nI’ll right thee, never fear!’\\n\\nShe took from her pocket a little purse.', 'He seized it with the same\\nrapid impatience which had characterised his speech, and hastily made\\nhis way to the other side of the screen.', 'It was impossible to restrain\\nhim, and the trembling child followed close behind.', 'The landlord had placed a light upon the table, and was engaged in\\ndrawing the curtain of the window.', 'The speakers whom they had heard\\nwere two men, who had a pack of cards and some silver money between\\nthem, while upon the screen itself the games they had played were\\nscored in chalk.', 'The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of\\nmiddle age, with large black whiskers, broad cheeks, a coarse wide\\nmouth, and bull neck, which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt\\ncollar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief.', 'He wore his hat,\\nwhich was of a brownish-white, and had beside him a thick knotted\\nstick.', 'The other man, whom his companion had called Isaac, was of a\\nmore slender figure--stooping, and high in the shoulders--with a very\\nill-favoured face, and a most sinister and villainous squint.', '‘Now old gentleman,’ said Isaac, looking round.', '‘Do you know either of\\nus?', 'This side of the screen is private, sir.’\\n\\n‘No offence, I hope,’ returned the old man.', '‘But by G--, sir, there is offence,’ said the other, interrupting him,\\n‘when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are\\nparticularly engaged.’\\n\\n‘I had no intention to offend,’ said the old man, looking anxiously at\\nthe cards.', '‘I thought that--’\\n\\n‘But you had no right to think, sir,’ retorted the other.', '‘What the\\ndevil has a man at your time of life to do with thinking?’\\n\\n‘Now bully boy,’ said the stout man, raising his eyes from his cards\\nfor the first time, ‘can’t you let him speak?’\\n\\nThe landlord, who had apparently resolved to remain neutral until he\\nknew which side of the question the stout man would espouse, chimed in\\nat this place with ‘Ah, to be sure, can’t you let him speak, Isaac\\nList?’\\n\\n‘Can’t I let him speak,’ sneered Isaac in reply, mimicking as nearly as\\nhe could, in his shrill voice, the tones of the landlord.', '‘Yes, I can\\nlet him speak, Jemmy Groves.’\\n\\n‘Well then, do it, will you?’ said the landlord.', 'Mr List’s squint assumed a portentous character, which seemed to\\nthreaten a prolongation of this controversy, when his companion, who\\nhad been looking sharply at the old man, put a timely stop to it.', '‘Who knows,’ said he, with a cunning look, ‘but the gentleman may have\\ncivilly meant to ask if he might have the honour to take a hand with\\nus!’\\n\\n‘I did mean it,’ cried the old man.', '‘That is what I mean.', 'That is\\nwhat I want now!’\\n\\n‘I thought so,’ returned the same man.', '‘Then who knows but the\\ngentleman, anticipating our objection to play for love, civilly desired\\nto play for money?’\\n\\nThe old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand, and\\nthen throwing it down upon the table, and gathering up the cards as a\\nmiser would clutch at gold.', '‘Oh!', 'That indeed,’ said Isaac; ‘if that’s what the gentleman meant, I\\nbeg the gentleman’s pardon.', 'Is this the gentleman’s little purse?', 'A\\nvery pretty little purse.', 'Rather a light purse,’ added Isaac, throwing\\nit into the air and catching it dexterously, ‘but enough to amuse a\\ngentleman for half an hour or so.’\\n\\n‘We’ll make a four-handed game of it, and take in Groves,’ said the\\nstout man.', '‘Come, Jemmy.’\\n\\nThe landlord, who conducted himself like one who was well used to such\\nlittle parties, approached the table and took his seat.', 'The child, in\\na perfect agony, drew her grandfather aside, and implored him, even\\nthen, to come away.', '‘Come; and we may be so happy,’ said the child.', '‘We WILL be happy,’ replied the old man hastily.', '‘Let me go, Nell.', 'The means of happiness are on the cards and the dice.', 'We must rise\\nfrom little winnings to great.', 'There’s little to be won here; but\\ngreat will come in time.', 'I shall but win back my own, and it’s all for\\nthee, my darling.’\\n\\n‘God help us!’ cried the child.', '‘Oh!', 'what hard fortune brought us\\nhere?’\\n\\n‘Hush!’ rejoined the old man laying his hand upon her mouth, ‘Fortune\\nwill not bear chiding.', 'We must not reproach her, or she shuns us; I\\nhave found that out.’\\n\\n‘Now, mister,’ said the stout man.', '‘If you’re not coming yourself,\\ngive us the cards, will you?’\\n\\n‘I am coming,’ cried the old man.', '‘Sit thee down, Nell, sit thee down\\nand look on.', 'Be of good heart, it’s all for thee--all--every penny.', 'I don’t tell them, no, no, or else they wouldn’t play, dreading the\\nchance that such a cause must give me.', 'Look at them.', 'See what they\\nare and what thou art.', 'Who doubts that we must win!’\\n\\n‘The gentleman has thought better of it, and isn’t coming,’ said Isaac,\\nmaking as though he would rise from the table.', '‘I’m sorry the\\ngentleman’s daunted--nothing venture, nothing have--but the gentleman\\nknows best.’\\n\\n‘Why I am ready.', 'You have all been slow but me,’ said the old man.', '‘I\\nwonder who is more anxious to begin than I.’\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew a chair to the table; and the other three closing\\nround it at the same time, the game commenced.', 'The child sat by, and watched its progress with a troubled mind.', 'Regardless of the run of luck, and mindful only of the desperate\\npassion which had its hold upon her grandfather, losses and gains were\\nto her alike.', 'Exulting in some brief triumph, or cast down by a\\ndefeat, there he sat so wild and restless, so feverishly and intensely\\nanxious, so terribly eager, so ravenous for the paltry stakes, that she\\ncould have almost better borne to see him dead.', 'And yet she was the\\ninnocent cause of all this torture, and he, gambling with such a savage\\nthirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt, had not one\\nselfish thought!', 'On the contrary, the other three--knaves and gamesters by their\\ntrade--while intent upon their game, were yet as cool and quiet as if\\nevery virtue had been centered in their breasts.', 'Sometimes one would\\nlook up to smile to another, or to snuff the feeble candle, or to\\nglance at the lightning as it shot through the open window and\\nfluttering curtain, or to listen to some louder peal of thunder than\\nthe rest, with a kind of momentary impatience, as if it put him out;\\nbut there they sat, with a calm indifference to everything but their\\ncards, perfect philosophers in appearance, and with no greater show of\\npassion or excitement than if they had been made of stone.', 'The storm had raged for full three hours; the lightning had grown\\nfainter and less frequent; the thunder, from seeming to roll and break\\nabove their heads, had gradually died away into a deep hoarse distance;\\nand still the game went on, and still the anxious child was quite\\nforgotten.', 'CHAPTER 30\\n\\nAt length the play came to an end, and Mr Isaac List rose the only\\nwinner.', 'Mat and the landlord bore their losses with professional\\nfortitude.', 'Isaac pocketed his gains with the air of a man who had\\nquite made up his mind to win, all along, and was neither surprised nor\\npleased.', 'Nell’s little purse was exhausted; but although it lay empty by his\\nside, and the other players had now risen from the table, the old man\\nsat poring over the cards, dealing them as they had been dealt before,\\nand turning up the different hands to see what each man would have held\\nif they had still been playing.', 'He was quite absorbed in this\\noccupation, when the child drew near and laid her hand upon his\\nshoulder, telling him it was near midnight.', '‘See the curse of poverty, Nell,’ he said, pointing to the packs he had\\nspread out upon the table.', '‘If I could have gone on a little longer,\\nonly a little longer, the luck would have turned on my side.', 'Yes, it’s\\nas plain as the marks upon the cards.', 'See here--and there--and here\\nagain.’\\n\\n‘Put them away,’ urged the child.', '‘Try to forget them.’\\n\\n‘Try to forget them!’ he rejoined, raising his haggard face to hers,\\nand regarding her with an incredulous stare.', '‘To forget them!', 'How are\\nwe ever to grow rich if I forget them?’\\n\\nThe child could only shake her head.', '‘No, no, Nell,’ said the old man, patting her cheek; ‘they must not be\\nforgotten.', 'We must make amends for this as soon as we can.', 'Patience--patience, and we’ll right thee yet, I promise thee.', 'Lose\\nto-day, win to-morrow.', 'And nothing can be won without anxiety and\\ncare--nothing.', 'Come, I am ready.’\\n\\n‘Do you know what the time is?’ said Mr Groves, who was smoking with\\nhis friends.', '‘Past twelve o’clock--’\\n\\n‘--And a rainy night,’ added the stout man.', '‘The Valiant Soldier, by James Groves.', 'Good beds.', 'Cheap entertainment\\nfor man and beast,’ said Mr Groves, quoting his sign-board.', '‘Half-past\\ntwelve o’clock.’\\n\\n‘It’s very late,’ said the uneasy child.', '‘I wish we had gone before.', 'What will they think of us!', 'It will be two o’clock by the time we get\\nback.', 'What would it cost, sir, if we stopped here?’\\n\\n‘Two good beds, one-and-sixpence; supper and beer one shilling; total\\ntwo shillings and sixpence,’ replied the Valiant Soldier.', 'Now, Nell had still the piece of gold sewn in her dress; and when she\\ncame to consider the lateness of the hour, and the somnolent habits of\\nMrs Jarley, and to imagine the state of consternation in which they\\nwould certainly throw that good lady by knocking her up in the middle\\nof the night--and when she reflected, on the other hand, that if they\\nremained where they were, and rose early in the morning, they might get\\nback before she awoke, and could plead the violence of the storm by\\nwhich they had been overtaken, as a good apology for their absence--she\\ndecided, after a great deal of hesitation, to remain.', 'She therefore\\ntook her grandfather aside, and telling him that she had still enough\\nleft to defray the cost of their lodging, proposed that they should\\nstay there for the night.', '‘If I had had but that money before--If I had only known of it a few\\nminutes ago!’ muttered the old man.', '‘We will decide to stop here if you please,’ said Nell, turning hastily\\nto the landlord.', '‘I think that’s prudent,’ returned Mr Groves.', '‘You shall have your\\nsuppers directly.’\\n\\nAccordingly, when Mr Groves had smoked his pipe out, knocked out the\\nashes, and placed it carefully in a corner of the fire-place, with the\\nbowl downwards, he brought in the bread and cheese, and beer, with many\\nhigh encomiums upon their excellence, and bade his guests fall to, and\\nmake themselves at home.', 'Nell and her grandfather ate sparingly, for\\nboth were occupied with their own reflections; the other gentlemen, for\\nwhose constitutions beer was too weak and tame a liquid, consoled\\nthemselves with spirits and tobacco.', 'As they would leave the house very early in the morning, the child was\\nanxious to pay for their entertainment before they retired to bed.', 'But\\nas she felt the necessity of concealing her little hoard from her\\ngrandfather, and had to change the piece of gold, she took it secretly\\nfrom its place of concealment, and embraced an opportunity of following\\nthe landlord when he went out of the room, and tendered it to him in\\nthe little bar.', '‘Will you give me the change here, if you please?’ said the child.', 'Mr James Groves was evidently surprised, and looked at the money, and\\nrang it, and looked at the child, and at the money again, as though he\\nhad a mind to inquire how she came by it.', 'The coin being genuine,\\nhowever, and changed at his house, he probably felt, like a wise\\nlandlord, that it was no business of his.', 'At any rate, he counted out\\nthe change, and gave it her.', 'The child was returning to the room where\\nthey had passed the evening, when she fancied she saw a figure just\\ngliding in at the door.', 'There was nothing but a long dark passage\\nbetween this door and the place where she had changed the money, and,\\nbeing very certain that no person had passed in or out while she stood\\nthere, the thought struck her that she had been watched.', 'But by whom?', 'When she re-entered the room, she found its inmates\\nexactly as she had left them.', 'The stout fellow lay upon two chairs,\\nresting his head on his hand, and the squinting man reposed in a\\nsimilar attitude on the opposite side of the table.', 'Between them sat\\nher grandfather, looking intently at the winner with a kind of hungry\\nadmiration, and hanging upon his words as if he were some superior\\nbeing.', 'She was puzzled for a moment, and looked round to see if any\\nelse were there.', 'No.', 'Then she asked her grandfather in a whisper\\nwhether anybody had left the room while she was absent.', '‘No,’ he said,\\n‘nobody.’\\n\\nIt must have been her fancy then; and yet it was strange, that, without\\nanything in her previous thoughts to lead to it, she should have\\nimagined this figure so very distinctly.', 'She was still wondering and\\nthinking of it, when a girl came to light her to bed.', 'The old man took leave of the company at the same time, and they went\\nup stairs together.', 'It was a great, rambling house, with dull\\ncorridors and wide staircases which the flaring candles seemed to make\\nmore gloomy.', 'She left her grandfather in his chamber, and followed her\\nguide to another, which was at the end of a passage, and approached by\\nsome half-dozen crazy steps.', 'This was prepared for her.', 'The girl\\nlingered a little while to talk, and tell her grievances.', 'She had not\\na good place, she said; the wages were low, and the work was hard.', 'She\\nwas going to leave it in a fortnight; the child couldn’t recommend her\\nto another, she supposed?', 'Instead she was afraid another would be\\ndifficult to get after living there, for the house had a very\\nindifferent character; there was far too much card-playing, and such\\nlike.', 'She was very much mistaken if some of the people who came there\\noftenest were quite as honest as they might be, but she wouldn’t have\\nit known that she had said so, for the world.', 'Then there were some\\nrambling allusions to a rejected sweetheart, who had threatened to go a\\nsoldiering--a final promise of knocking at the door early in the\\nmorning--and ‘Good night.’\\n\\nThe child did not feel comfortable when she was left alone.', 'She could\\nnot help thinking of the figure stealing through the passage down\\nstairs; and what the girl had said did not tend to reassure her.', 'The\\nmen were very ill-looking.', 'They might get their living by robbing and\\nmurdering travellers.', 'Who could tell?', 'Reasoning herself out of these fears, or losing sight of them for a\\nlittle while, there came the anxiety to which the adventures of the\\nnight gave rise.', 'Here was the old passion awakened again in her\\ngrandfather’s breast, and to what further distraction it might tempt\\nhim Heaven only knew.', 'What fears their absence might have occasioned\\nalready!', 'Persons might be seeking for them even then.', 'Would they be\\nforgiven in the morning, or turned adrift again!', 'Oh!', 'why had they\\nstopped in that strange place?', 'It would have been better, under any\\ncircumstances, to have gone on!', 'At last, sleep gradually stole upon her--a broken, fitful sleep,\\ntroubled by dreams of falling from high towers, and waking with a start\\nand in great terror.', 'A deeper slumber followed this--and then--What!', 'That figure in the room.', 'A figure was there.', 'Yes, she had drawn up the blind to admit the light\\nwhen it should be dawn, and there, between the foot of the bed and the\\ndark casement, it crouched and slunk along, groping its way with\\nnoiseless hands, and stealing round the bed.', 'She had no voice to cry\\nfor help, no power to move, but lay still, watching it.', 'On it came--on, silently and stealthily, to the bed’s head.', 'The breath\\nso near her pillow, that she shrunk back into it, lest those wandering\\nhands should light upon her face.', 'Back again it stole to the\\nwindow--then turned its head towards her.', 'The dark form was a mere blot upon the lighter darkness of the room,\\nbut she saw the turning of the head, and felt and knew how the eyes\\nlooked and the ears listened.', 'There it remained, motionless as she.', 'At length, still keeping the face towards her, it busied its hands in\\nsomething, and she heard the chink of money.', 'Then, on it came again, silent and stealthy as before, and replacing\\nthe garments it had taken from the bedside, dropped upon its hands and\\nknees, and crawled away.', 'How slowly it seemed to move, now that she\\ncould hear but not see it, creeping along the floor!', 'It reached the\\ndoor at last, and stood upon its feet.', 'The steps creaked beneath its\\nnoiseless tread, and it was gone.', 'The first impulse of the child was to fly from the terror of being by\\nherself in that room--to have somebody by--not to be alone--and then\\nher power of speech would be restored.', 'With no consciousness of having\\nmoved, she gained the door.', 'There was the dreadful shadow, pausing at the bottom of the steps.', 'She could not pass it; she might have done so, perhaps, in the darkness\\nwithout being seized, but her blood curdled at the thought.', 'The figure\\nstood quite still, and so did she; not boldly, but of necessity; for\\ngoing back into the room was hardly less terrible than going on.', 'The rain beat fast and furiously without, and ran down in plashing\\nstreams from the thatched roof.', 'Some summer insect, with no escape\\ninto the air, flew blindly to and fro, beating its body against the\\nwalls and ceiling, and filling the silent place with murmurs.', 'The\\nfigure moved again.', 'The child involuntarily did the same.', 'Once in her\\ngrandfather’s room, she would be safe.', 'It crept along the passage until it came to the very door she longed so\\nardently to reach.', 'The child, in the agony of being so near, had\\nalmost darted forward with the design of bursting into the room and\\nclosing it behind her, when the figure stopped again.', 'The idea flashed suddenly upon her--what if it entered there, and had a\\ndesign upon the old man’s life!', 'She turned faint and sick.', 'It did.', 'It went in.', 'There was a light inside.', 'The figure was now within the\\nchamber, and she, still dumb--quite dumb, and almost senseless--stood\\nlooking on.', 'The door was partly open.', 'Not knowing what she meant to do, but\\nmeaning to preserve him or be killed herself, she staggered forward and\\nlooked in.', 'What sight was that which met her view!', 'The bed had not been lain on, but was smooth and empty.', 'And at a table\\nsat the old man himself; the only living creature there; his white face\\npinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally\\nbright--counting the money of which his hands had robbed her.', 'CHAPTER 31\\n\\nWith steps more faltering and unsteady than those with which she had\\napproached the room, the child withdrew from the door, and groped her\\nway back to her own chamber.', 'The terror she had lately felt was\\nnothing compared with that which now oppressed her.', 'No strange robber,\\nno treacherous host conniving at the plunder of his guests, or stealing\\nto their beds to kill them in their sleep, no nightly prowler, however\\nterrible and cruel, could have awakened in her bosom half the dread\\nwhich the recognition of her silent visitor inspired.', 'The grey-headed\\nold man gliding like a ghost into her room and acting the thief while\\nhe supposed her fast asleep, then bearing off his prize and hanging\\nover it with the ghastly exultation she had witnessed, was\\nworse--immeasurably worse, and far more dreadful, for the moment, to\\nreflect upon--than anything her wildest fancy could have suggested.', 'If he should return--there was no lock or bolt upon the door, and if,\\ndistrustful of having left some money yet behind, he should come back\\nto seek for more--a vague awe and horror surrounded the idea of his\\nslinking in again with stealthy tread, and turning his face toward the\\nempty bed, while she shrank down close at his feet to avoid his touch,\\nwhich was almost insupportable.', 'She sat and listened.', 'Hark!', 'A\\nfootstep on the stairs, and now the door was slowly opening.', 'It was\\nbut imagination, yet imagination had all the terrors of reality; nay,\\nit was worse, for the reality would have come and gone, and there an\\nend, but in imagination it was always coming, and never went away.', 'The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror.', 'She\\nhad no fear of the dear old grandfather, in whose love for her this\\ndisease of the brain had been engendered; but the man she had seen that\\nnight, wrapt in the game of chance, lurking in her room, and counting\\nthe money by the glimmering light, seemed like another creature in his\\nshape, a monstrous distortion of his image, a something to recoil from,\\nand be the more afraid of, because it bore a likeness to him, and kept\\nclose about her, as he did.', 'She could scarcely connect her own\\naffectionate companion, save by his loss, with this old man, so like\\nyet so unlike him.', 'She had wept to see him dull and quiet.', 'How much\\ngreater cause she had for weeping now!', 'The child sat watching and thinking of these things, until the phantom\\nin her mind so increased in gloom and terror, that she felt it would be\\na relief to hear the old man’s voice, or, if he were asleep, even to\\nsee him, and banish some of the fears that clustered round his image.', 'She stole down the stairs and passage again.', 'The door was still ajar\\nas she had left it, and the candle burning as before.', 'She had her own candle in her hand, prepared to say, if he were waking,\\nthat she was uneasy and could not rest, and had come to see if his were\\nstill alight.', 'Looking into the room, she saw him lying calmly on his\\nbed, and so took courage to enter.', 'Fast asleep.', 'No passion in the face, no avarice, no anxiety, no wild\\ndesire; all gentle, tranquil, and at peace.', 'This was not the gambler,\\nor the shadow in her room; this was not even the worn and jaded man\\nwhose face had so often met her own in the grey morning light; this was\\nher dear old friend, her harmless fellow-traveller, her good, kind\\ngrandfather.', 'She had no fear as she looked upon his slumbering features, but she had\\na deep and weighty sorrow, and it found its relief in tears.', '‘God bless him!’ said the child, stooping softly to kiss his placid\\ncheek.', '‘I see too well now, that they would indeed part us if they\\nfound us out, and shut him up from the light of the sun and sky.', 'He\\nhas only me to help him.', 'God bless us both!’\\n\\nLighting her candle, she retreated as silently as she had come, and,\\ngaining her own room once more, sat up during the remainder of that\\nlong, long, miserable night.', 'At last the day turned her waning candle pale, and she fell asleep.', 'She was quickly roused by the girl who had shown her up to bed; and, as\\nsoon as she was dressed, prepared to go down to her grandfather.', 'But\\nfirst she searched her pocket and found that her money was all\\ngone--not a sixpence remained.', 'The old man was ready, and in a few seconds they were on their road.', 'The child thought he rather avoided her eye, and appeared to expect\\nthat she would tell him of her loss.', 'She felt she must do that, or he\\nmight suspect the truth.', '‘Grandfather,’ she said in a tremulous voice, after they had walked\\nabout a mile in silence, ‘do you think they are honest people at the\\nhouse yonder?’\\n\\n‘Why?’ returned the old man trembling.', '‘Do I think them honest--yes,\\nthey played honestly.’\\n\\n‘I’ll tell you why I ask,’ rejoined Nell.', '‘I lost some money last\\nnight--out of my bedroom, I am sure.', 'Unless it was taken by somebody\\nin jest--only in jest, dear grandfather, which would make me laugh\\nheartily if I could but know it--’\\n\\n‘Who would take money in jest?’ returned the old man in a hurried\\nmanner.', '‘Those who take money, take it to keep.', 'Don’t talk of jest.’\\n\\n‘Then it was stolen out of my room, dear,’ said the child, whose last\\nhope was destroyed by the manner of this reply.', '‘But is there no more, Nell?’ said the old man; ‘no more anywhere?', 'Was\\nit all taken--every farthing of it--was there nothing left?’\\n\\n‘Nothing,’ replied the child.', '‘We must get more,’ said the old man, ‘we must earn it, Nell, hoard it\\nup, scrape it together, come by it somehow.', 'Never mind this loss.', 'Tell nobody of it, and perhaps we may regain it.', 'Don’t ask how;--we\\nmay regain it, and a great deal more;--but tell nobody, or trouble may\\ncome of it.', 'And so they took it out of thy room, when thou wert\\nasleep!’ he added in a compassionate tone, very different from the\\nsecret, cunning way in which he had spoken until now.', '‘Poor Nell, poor\\nlittle Nell!’\\n\\nThe child hung down her head and wept.', 'The sympathising tone in which\\nhe spoke, was quite sincere; she was sure of that.', 'It was not the\\nlightest part of her sorrow to know that this was done for her.', '‘Not a word about it to any one but me,’ said the old man, ‘no, not\\neven to me,’ he added hastily, ‘for it can do no good.', 'All the losses\\nthat ever were, are not worth tears from thy eyes, darling.', 'Why should\\nthey be, when we will win them back?’\\n\\n‘Let them go,’ said the child looking up.', '‘Let them go, once and for\\never, and I would never shed another tear if every penny had been a\\nthousand pounds.’\\n\\n‘Well, well,’ returned the old man, checking himself as some impetuous\\nanswer rose to his lips, ‘she knows no better.', 'I ought to be thankful\\nof it.’\\n\\n‘But listen to me,’ said the child earnestly, ‘will you listen to me?’\\n\\n‘Aye, aye, I’ll listen,’ returned the old man, still without looking at\\nher; ‘a pretty voice.', 'It has always a sweet sound to me.', 'It always\\nhad when it was her mother’s, poor child.’\\n\\n‘Let me persuade you, then--oh, do let me persuade you,’ said the\\nchild, ‘to think no more of gains or losses, and to try no fortune but\\nthe fortune we pursue together.’\\n\\n‘We pursue this aim together,’ retorted her grandfather, still looking\\naway and seeming to confer with himself.', '‘Whose image sanctifies the\\ngame?’\\n\\n‘Have we been worse off,’ resumed the child, ‘since you forgot these\\ncares, and we have been travelling on together?', 'Have we not been much\\nbetter and happier without a home to shelter us, than ever we were in\\nthat unhappy house, when they were on your mind?’\\n\\n‘She speaks the truth,’ murmured the old man in the same tone as\\nbefore.', '‘It must not turn me, but it is the truth; no doubt it is.’\\n\\n‘Only remember what we have been since that bright morning when we\\nturned our backs upon it for the last time,’ said Nell, ‘only remember\\nwhat we have been since we have been free of all those miseries--what\\npeaceful days and quiet nights we have had--what pleasant times we have\\nknown--what happiness we have enjoyed.', 'If we have been tired or\\nhungry, we have been soon refreshed, and slept the sounder for it.', 'Think what beautiful things we have seen, and how contented we have\\nfelt.', 'And why was this blessed change?’\\n\\nHe stopped her with a motion of his hand, and bade her talk to him no\\nmore just then, for he was busy.', 'After a time he kissed her cheek,\\nstill motioning her to silence, and walked on, looking far before him,\\nand sometimes stopping and gazing with a puckered brow upon the ground,\\nas if he were painfully trying to collect his disordered thoughts.', 'Once she saw tears in his eyes.', 'When he had gone on thus for some\\ntime, he took her hand in his as he was accustomed to do, with nothing\\nof the violence or animation of his late manner; and so, by degrees so\\nfine that the child could not trace them, he settled down into his\\nusual quiet way, and suffered her to lead him where she would.', 'When they presented themselves in the midst of the stupendous\\ncollection, they found, as Nell had anticipated, that Mrs Jarley was\\nnot yet out of bed, and that, although she had suffered some uneasiness\\non their account overnight, and had indeed sat up for them until past\\neleven o’clock, she had retired in the persuasion, that, being\\novertaken by storm at some distance from home, they had sought the\\nnearest shelter, and would not return before morning.', 'Nell immediately\\napplied herself with great assiduity to the decoration and preparation\\nof the room, and had the satisfaction of completing her task, and\\ndressing herself neatly, before the beloved of the Royal Family came\\ndown to breakfast.', '‘We haven’t had,’ said Mrs Jarley when the meal was over, ‘more than\\neight of Miss Monflathers’s young ladies all the time we’ve been here,\\nand there’s twenty-six of ‘em, as I was told by the cook when I asked\\nher a question or two and put her on the free-list.', 'We must try ‘em\\nwith a parcel of new bills, and you shall take it, my dear, and see\\nwhat effect that has upon ‘em.’\\n\\nThe proposed expedition being one of paramount importance, Mrs Jarley\\nadjusted Nell’s bonnet with her own hands, and declaring that she\\ncertainly did look very pretty, and reflected credit on the\\nestablishment, dismissed her with many commendations, and certain\\nneedful directions as to the turnings on the right which she was to\\ntake, and the turnings on the left which she was to avoid.', 'Thus\\ninstructed, Nell had no difficulty in finding out Miss Monflathers’s\\nBoarding and Day Establishment, which was a large house, with a high\\nwall, and a large garden-gate with a large brass plate, and a small\\ngrating through which Miss Monflathers’s parlour-maid inspected all\\nvisitors before admitting them; for nothing in the shape of a man--no,\\nnot even a milkman--was suffered, without special license, to pass that\\ngate.', 'Even the tax-gatherer, who was stout, and wore spectacles and a\\nbroad-brimmed hat, had the taxes handed through the grating.', 'More\\nobdurate than gate of adamant or brass, this gate of Miss Monflathers’s\\nfrowned on all mankind.', 'The very butcher respected it as a gate of\\nmystery, and left off whistling when he rang the bell.', 'As Nell approached the awful door, it turned slowly upon its hinges\\nwith a creaking noise, and, forth from the solemn grove beyond, came a\\nlong file of young ladies, two and two, all with open books in their\\nhands, and some with parasols likewise.', 'And last of the goodly\\nprocession came Miss Monflathers, bearing herself a parasol of lilac\\nsilk, and supported by two smiling teachers, each mortally envious of\\nthe other, and devoted unto Miss Monflathers.', 'Confused by the looks and whispers of the girls, Nell stood with\\ndowncast eyes and suffered the procession to pass on, until Miss\\nMonflathers, bringing up the rear, approached her, when she curtseyed\\nand presented her little packet; on receipt whereof Miss Monflathers\\ncommanded that the line should halt.', '‘You’re the wax-work child, are you not?’ said Miss Monflathers.', '‘Yes, ma’am,’ replied Nell, colouring deeply, for the young ladies had\\ncollected about her, and she was the centre on which all eyes were\\nfixed.', '‘And don’t you think you must be a very wicked little child,’ said Miss\\nMonflathers, who was of rather uncertain temper, and lost no\\nopportunity of impressing moral truths upon the tender minds of the\\nyoung ladies, ‘to be a wax-work child at all?’\\n\\nPoor Nell had never viewed her position in this light, and not knowing\\nwhat to say, remained silent, blushing more deeply than before.', '‘Don’t you know,’ said Miss Monflathers, ‘that it’s very naughty and\\nunfeminine, and a perversion of the properties wisely and benignantly\\ntransmitted to us, with expansive powers to be roused from their\\ndormant state through the medium of cultivation?’\\n\\nThe two teachers murmured their respectful approval of this\\nhome-thrust, and looked at Nell as though they would have said that\\nthere indeed Miss Monflathers had hit her very hard.', 'Then they smiled\\nand glanced at Miss Monflathers, and then, their eyes meeting, they\\nexchanged looks which plainly said that each considered herself smiler\\nin ordinary to Miss Monflathers, and regarded the other as having no\\nright to smile, and that her so doing was an act of presumption and\\nimpertinence.', '‘Don’t you feel how naughty it is of you,’ resumed Miss Monflathers,\\n‘to be a wax-work child, when you might have the proud consciousness of\\nassisting, to the extent of your infant powers, the manufactures of\\nyour country; of improving your mind by the constant contemplation of\\nthe steam-engine; and of earning a comfortable and independent\\nsubsistence of from two-and-ninepence to three shillings per week?', 'Don’t you know that the harder you are at work, the happier you are?’\\n\\n‘“How doth the little--“’ murmured one of the teachers, in quotation\\nfrom Doctor Watts.', '‘Eh?’ said Miss Monflathers, turning smartly round.', '‘Who said that?’\\n\\nOf course the teacher who had not said it, indicated the rival who had,\\nwhom Miss Monflathers frowningly requested to hold her peace; by that\\nmeans throwing the informing teacher into raptures of joy.', '‘The little busy bee,’ said Miss Monflathers, drawing herself up, ‘is\\napplicable only to genteel children.', '“In books, or work, or healthful play”\\n\\nis quite right as far as they are concerned; and the work means\\npainting on velvet, fancy needle-work, or embroidery.', 'In such cases as\\nthese,’ pointing to Nell, with her parasol, ‘and in the case of all\\npoor people’s children, we should read it thus:\\n\\n\\n  “In work, work, work.', 'In work alway\\n  Let my first years be past,\\n  That I may give for ev’ry day\\n  Some good account at last.”’\\n\\n\\nA deep hum of applause rose not only from the two teachers, but from\\nall the pupils, who were equally astonished to hear Miss Monflathers\\nimprovising after this brilliant style; for although she had been long\\nknown as a politician, she had never appeared before as an original\\npoet.', 'Just then somebody happened to discover that Nell was crying,\\nand all eyes were again turned towards her.', 'There were indeed tears in her eyes, and drawing out her handkerchief\\nto brush them away, she happened to let it fall.', 'Before she could\\nstoop to pick it up, one young lady of about fifteen or sixteen, who\\nhad been standing a little apart from the others, as though she had no\\nrecognised place among them, sprang forward and put it in her hand.', 'She was gliding timidly away again, when she was arrested by the\\ngoverness.', '‘It was Miss Edwards who did that, I KNOW,’ said Miss Monflathers\\npredictively.', '‘Now I am sure that was Miss Edwards.’\\n\\nIt was Miss Edwards, and everybody said it was Miss Edwards, and Miss\\nEdwards herself admitted that it was.', '‘Is it not,’ said Miss Monflathers, putting down her parasol to take a\\nseverer view of the offender, ‘a most remarkable thing, Miss Edwards,\\nthat you have an attachment to the lower classes which always draws you\\nto their sides; or, rather, is it not a most extraordinary thing that\\nall I say and do will not wean you from propensities which your\\noriginal station in life have unhappily rendered habitual to you, you\\nextremely vulgar-minded girl?’\\n\\n‘I really intended no harm, ma’am,’ said a sweet voice.', '‘It was a\\nmomentary impulse, indeed.’\\n\\n‘An impulse!’ repeated Miss Monflathers scornfully.', '‘I wonder that you\\npresume to speak of impulses to me’--both the teachers assented--‘I am\\nastonished’--both the teachers were astonished--‘I suppose it is an\\nimpulse which induces you to take the part of every grovelling and\\ndebased person that comes in your way’--both the teachers supposed so\\ntoo.', '‘But I would have you know, Miss Edwards,’ resumed the governess in a\\ntone of increased severity, ‘that you cannot be permitted--if it be\\nonly for the sake of preserving a proper example and decorum in this\\nestablishment--that you cannot be permitted, and that you shall not be\\npermitted, to fly in the face of your superiors in this exceedingly\\ngross manner.', 'If you have no reason to feel a becoming pride before\\nwax-work children, there are young ladies here who have, and you must\\neither defer to those young ladies or leave the establishment, Miss\\nEdwards.’\\n\\nThis young lady, being motherless and poor, was apprenticed at the\\nschool--taught for nothing--teaching others what she learnt, for\\nnothing--boarded for nothing--lodged for nothing--and set down and\\nrated as something immeasurably less than nothing, by all the dwellers\\nin the house.', 'The servant-maids felt her inferiority, for they were\\nbetter treated; free to come and go, and regarded in their stations\\nwith much more respect.', 'The teachers were infinitely superior, for\\nthey had paid to go to school in their time, and were paid now.', 'The\\npupils cared little for a companion who had no grand stories to tell\\nabout home; no friends to come with post-horses, and be received in all\\nhumility, with cake and wine, by the governess; no deferential servant\\nto attend and bear her home for the holidays; nothing genteel to talk\\nabout, and nothing to display.', 'But why was Miss Monflathers always\\nvexed and irritated with the poor apprentice--how did that come to pass?', 'Why, the gayest feather in Miss Monflathers’s cap, and the brightest\\nglory of Miss Monflathers’s school, was a baronet’s daughter--the real\\nlive daughter of a real live baronet--who, by some extraordinary\\nreversal of the Laws of Nature, was not only plain in features but dull\\nin intellect, while the poor apprentice had both a ready wit, and a\\nhandsome face and figure.', 'It seems incredible.', 'Here was Miss Edwards,\\nwho only paid a small premium which had been spent long ago, every day\\noutshining and excelling the baronet’s daughter, who learned all the\\nextras (or was taught them all) and whose half-yearly bill came to\\ndouble that of any other young lady’s in the school, making no account\\nof the honour and reputation of her pupilage.', 'Therefore, and because\\nshe was a dependent, Miss Monflathers had a great dislike to Miss\\nEdwards, and was spiteful to her, and aggravated by her, and, when she\\nhad compassion on little Nell, verbally fell upon and maltreated her as\\nwe have already seen.', '‘You will not take the air to-day, Miss Edwards,’ said Miss\\nMonflathers.', '‘Have the goodness to retire to your own room, and not to\\nleave it without permission.’\\n\\nThe poor girl was moving hastily away, when she was suddenly, in\\nnautical phrase, ‘brought to’ by a subdued shriek from Miss Monflathers.', '‘She has passed me without any salute!’ cried the governess, raising\\nher eyes to the sky.', '‘She has actually passed me without the slightest\\nacknowledgment of my presence!’\\n\\nThe young lady turned and curtsied.', 'Nell could see that she raised her\\ndark eyes to the face of her superior, and that their expression, and\\nthat of her whole attitude for the instant, was one of mute but most\\ntouching appeal against this ungenerous usage.', 'Miss Monflathers only\\ntossed her head in reply, and the great gate closed upon a bursting\\nheart.', '‘As for you, you wicked child,’ said Miss Monflathers, turning to Nell,\\n‘tell your mistress that if she presumes to take the liberty of sending\\nto me any more, I will write to the legislative authorities and have\\nher put in the stocks, or compelled to do penance in a white sheet; and\\nyou may depend upon it that you shall certainly experience the\\ntreadmill if you dare to come here again.', 'Now ladies, on.’\\n\\nThe procession filed off, two and two, with the books and parasols, and\\nMiss Monflathers, calling the Baronet’s daughter to walk with her and\\nsmooth her ruffled feelings, discarded the two teachers--who by this\\ntime had exchanged their smiles for looks of sympathy--and left them\\nto bring up the rear, and hate each other a little more for being\\nobliged to walk together.', 'CHAPTER 32\\n\\nMrs Jarley’s wrath on first learning that she had been threatened with\\nthe indignity of Stocks and Penance, passed all description.', 'The\\ngenuine and only Jarley exposed to public scorn, jeered by children,\\nand flouted by beadles!', 'The delight of the Nobility and Gentry shorn\\nof a bonnet which a Lady Mayoress might have sighed to wear, and\\narrayed in a white sheet as a spectacle of mortification and humility!', 'And Miss Monflathers, the audacious creature who presumed, even in the\\ndimmest and remotest distance of her imagination, to conjure up the\\ndegrading picture, ‘I am a’most inclined,’ said Mrs Jarley, bursting\\nwith the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge,\\n‘to turn atheist when I think of it!’\\n\\nBut instead of adopting this course of retaliation, Mrs Jarley, on\\nsecond thoughts, brought out the suspicious bottle, and ordering\\nglasses to be set forth upon her favourite drum, and sinking into a\\nchair behind it, called her satellites about her, and to them several\\ntimes recounted, word for word, the affronts she had received.', 'This\\ndone, she begged them in a kind of deep despair to drink; then laughed,\\nthen cried, then took a little sip herself, then laughed and cried\\nagain, and took a little more; and so, by degrees, the worthy lady went\\non, increasing in smiles and decreasing in tears, until at last she\\ncould not laugh enough at Miss Monflathers, who, from being an object\\nof dire vexation, became one of sheer ridicule and absurdity.', '‘For which of us is best off, I wonder,’ quoth Mrs Jarley, ‘she or me!', 'It’s only talking, when all is said and done, and if she talks of me in\\nthe stocks, why I can talk of her in the stocks, which is a good deal\\nfunnier if we come to that.', 'Lord, what does it matter, after all!’\\n\\nHaving arrived at this comfortable frame of mind (to which she had been\\ngreatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the\\nphilosophical George), Mrs Jarley consoled Nell with many kind words,\\nand requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of Miss\\nMonflathers, she would do nothing else but laugh at her, all the days\\nof her life.', 'So ended Mrs Jarley’s wrath, which subsided long before the going down\\nof the sun.', 'Nell’s anxieties, however, were of a deeper kind, and the\\nchecks they imposed upon her cheerfulness were not so easily removed.', 'That evening, as she had dreaded, her grandfather stole away, and did\\nnot come back until the night was far spent.', 'Worn out as she was, and\\nfatigued in mind and body, she sat up alone, counting the minutes,\\nuntil he returned--penniless, broken-spirited, and wretched, but still\\nhotly bent upon his infatuation.', '‘Get me money,’ he said wildly, as they parted for the night.', '‘I must\\nhave money, Nell.', 'It shall be paid thee back with gallant interest one\\nday, but all the money that comes into thy hands, must be mine--not for\\nmyself, but to use for thee.', 'Remember, Nell, to use for thee!’\\n\\nWhat could the child do with the knowledge she had, but give him every\\npenny that came into her hands, lest he should be tempted on to rob\\ntheir benefactress?', 'If she told the truth (so thought the child) he\\nwould be treated as a madman; if she did not supply him with money, he\\nwould supply himself; supplying him, she fed the fire that burnt him\\nup, and put him perhaps beyond recovery.', 'Distracted by these thoughts,\\nborne down by the weight of the sorrow which she dared not tell,\\ntortured by a crowd of apprehensions whenever the old man was absent,\\nand dreading alike his stay and his return, the colour forsook her\\ncheek, her eye grew dim, and her heart was oppressed and heavy.', 'All\\nher old sorrows had come back upon her, augmented by new fears and\\ndoubts; by day they were ever present to her mind; by night they\\nhovered round her pillow, and haunted her in dreams.', 'It was natural that, in the midst of her affliction, she should often\\nrevert to that sweet young lady of whom she had only caught a hasty\\nglance, but whose sympathy, expressed in one slight brief action, dwelt\\nin her memory like the kindnesses of years.', 'She would often think, if\\nshe had such a friend as that to whom to tell her griefs, how much\\nlighter her heart would be--that if she were but free to hear that\\nvoice, she would be happier.', 'Then she would wish that she were\\nsomething better, that she were not quite so poor and humble, that she\\ndared address her without fearing a repulse; and then feel that there\\nwas an immeasurable distance between them, and have no hope that the\\nyoung lady thought of her any more.', 'It was now holiday-time at the schools, and the young ladies had gone\\nhome, and Miss Monflathers was reported to be flourishing in London,\\nand damaging the hearts of middle-aged gentlemen, but nobody said\\nanything about Miss Edwards, whether she had gone home, or whether she\\nhad any home to go to, whether she was still at the school, or anything\\nabout her.', 'But one evening, as Nell was returning from a lonely walk,\\nshe happened to pass the inn where the stage-coaches stopped, just as\\none drove up, and there was the beautiful girl she so well remembered,\\npressing forward to embrace a young child whom they were helping down\\nfrom the roof.', 'Well, this was her sister, her little sister, much younger than Nell,\\nwhom she had not seen (so the story went afterwards) for five years,\\nand to bring whom to that place on a short visit, she had been saving\\nher poor means all that time.', 'Nell felt as if her heart would break\\nwhen she saw them meet.', 'They went a little apart from the knot of\\npeople who had congregated about the coach, and fell upon each other’s\\nneck, and sobbed, and wept with joy.', 'Their plain and simple dress, the\\ndistance which the child had come alone, their agitation and delight,\\nand the tears they shed, would have told their history by themselves.', 'They became a little more composed in a short time, and went away, not\\nso much hand in hand as clinging to each other.', '‘Are you sure you’re\\nhappy, sister?’ said the child as they passed where Nell was standing.', '‘Quite happy now,’ she answered.', '‘But always?’ said the child.', '‘Ah,\\nsister, why do you turn away your face?’\\n\\nNell could not help following at a little distance.', 'They went to the\\nhouse of an old nurse, where the elder sister had engaged a bed-room\\nfor the child.', '‘I shall come to you early every morning,’ she said,\\n‘and we can be together all the day.’\\n\\n‘Why not at night-time too?', 'Dear sister, would they be angry with you\\nfor that?’\\n\\nWhy were the eyes of little Nell wet, that night, with tears like those\\nof the two sisters?', 'Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had\\nmet, and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part?', 'Let us\\nnot believe that any selfish reference--unconscious though it might\\nhave been--to her own trials awoke this sympathy, but thank God that\\nthe innocent joys of others can strongly move us, and that we, even in\\nour fallen nature, have one source of pure emotion which must be prized\\nin Heaven!', 'By morning’s cheerful glow, but oftener still by evening’s gentle\\nlight, the child, with a respect for the short and happy intercourse of\\nthese two sisters which forbade her to approach and say a thankful\\nword, although she yearned to do so, followed them at a distance in\\ntheir walks and rambles, stopping when they stopped, sitting on the\\ngrass when they sat down, rising when they went on, and feeling it a\\ncompanionship and delight to be so near them.', 'Their evening walk was\\nby a river’s side.', 'Here, every night, the child was too, unseen by\\nthem, unthought of, unregarded; but feeling as if they were her\\nfriends, as if they had confidences and trusts together, as if her load\\nwere lightened and less hard to bear; as if they mingled their sorrows,\\nand found mutual consolation.', 'It was a weak fancy perhaps, the\\nchildish fancy of a young and lonely creature; but night after night,\\nand still the sisters loitered in the same place, and still the child\\nfollowed with a mild and softened heart.', 'She was much startled, on returning home one night, to find that Mrs\\nJarley had commanded an announcement to be prepared, to the effect that\\nthe stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one\\nday longer; in fulfilment of which threat (for all announcements\\nconnected with public amusements are well known to be irrevocable and\\nmost exact), the stupendous collection shut up next day.', '‘Are we going from this place directly, ma’am?’ said Nell.', '‘Look here, child,’ returned Mrs Jarley.', '‘That’ll inform you.’ And so\\nsaying Mrs Jarley produced another announcement, wherein it was stated,\\nthat, in consequence of numerous inquiries at the wax-work door, and in\\nconsequence of crowds having been disappointed in obtaining admission,\\nthe Exhibition would be continued for one week longer, and would\\nre-open next day.', '‘For now that the schools are gone, and the regular sight-seers\\nexhausted,’ said Mrs Jarley, ‘we come to the General Public, and they\\nwant stimulating.’\\n\\nUpon the following day at noon, Mrs Jarley established herself behind\\nthe highly-ornamented table, attended by the distinguished effigies\\nbefore mentioned, and ordered the doors to be thrown open for the\\nreadmission of a discerning and enlightened public.', 'But the first\\nday’s operations were by no means of a successful character, inasmuch\\nas the general public, though they manifested a lively interest in Mrs\\nJarley personally, and such of her waxen satellites as were to be seen\\nfor nothing, were not affected by any impulses moving them to the\\npayment of sixpence a head.', 'Thus, notwithstanding that a great many\\npeople continued to stare at the entry and the figures therein\\ndisplayed; and remained there with great perseverance, by the hour at a\\ntime, to hear the barrel-organ played and to read the bills; and\\nnotwithstanding that they were kind enough to recommend their friends\\nto patronise the exhibition in the like manner, until the door-way was\\nregularly blockaded by half the population of the town, who, when they\\nwent off duty, were relieved by the other half; it was not found that\\nthe treasury was any the richer, or that the prospects of the\\nestablishment were at all encouraging.', 'In this depressed state of the classical market, Mrs Jarley made\\nextraordinary efforts to stimulate the popular taste, and whet the\\npopular curiosity.', 'Certain machinery in the body of the nun on the\\nleads over the door was cleaned up and put in motion, so that the\\nfigure shook its head paralytically all day long, to the great\\nadmiration of a drunken, but very Protestant, barber over the way, who\\nlooked upon the said paralytic motion as typical of the degrading\\neffect wrought upon the human mind by the ceremonies of the Romish\\nChurch and discoursed upon that theme with great eloquence and\\nmorality.', 'The two carters constantly passed in and out of the\\nexhibition-room, under various disguises, protesting aloud that the\\nsight was better worth the money than anything they had beheld in all\\ntheir lives, and urging the bystanders, with tears in their eyes, not\\nto neglect such a brilliant gratification.', 'Mrs Jarley sat in the\\npay-place, chinking silver moneys from noon till night, and solemnly\\ncalling upon the crowd to take notice that the price of admission was\\nonly sixpence, and that the departure of the whole collection, on a\\nshort tour among the Crowned Heads of Europe, was positively fixed for\\nthat day week.', '‘So be in time, be in time, be in time,’ said Mrs Jarley at the close\\nof every such address.', '‘Remember that this is Jarley’s stupendous\\ncollection of upwards of One Hundred Figures, and that it is the only\\ncollection in the world; all others being imposters and deceptions.', 'Be\\nin time, be in time, be in time!’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 33\\n\\nAs the course of this tale requires that we should become acquainted,\\nsomewhere hereabouts, with a few particulars connected with the\\ndomestic economy of Mr Sampson Brass, and as a more convenient place\\nthan the present is not likely to occur for that purpose, the historian\\ntakes the friendly reader by the hand, and springing with him into the\\nair, and cleaving the same at a greater rate than ever Don Cleophas\\nLeandro Perez Zambullo and his familiar travelled through that pleasant\\nregion in company, alights with him upon the pavement of Bevis Marks.', 'The intrepid aeronauts alight before a small dark house, once the\\nresidence of Mr Sampson Brass.', 'In the parlour window of this little habitation, which is so close upon\\nthe footway that the passenger who takes the wall brushes the dim glass\\nwith his coat sleeve--much to its improvement, for it is very dirty--in\\nthis parlour window in the days of its occupation by Sampson Brass,\\nthere hung, all awry and slack, and discoloured by the sun, a curtain\\nof faded green, so threadbare from long service as by no means to\\nintercept the view of the little dark room, but rather to afford a\\nfavourable medium through which to observe it accurately.', 'There was\\nnot much to look at.', 'A rickety table, with spare bundles of papers,\\nyellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket, ostentatiously\\ndisplayed upon its top; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite\\nsides of this crazy piece of furniture; a treacherous old chair by the\\nfire-place, whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and\\nhelped to squeeze him dry; a second-hand wig box, used as a depository\\nfor blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law, once the\\nsole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to\\nthe box, as they were now of the box itself; two or three common books\\nof practice; a jar of ink, a pounce box, a stunted hearth-broom, a\\ncarpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of\\ndesperation to its tacks--these, with the yellow wainscot of the walls,\\nthe smoke-discoloured ceiling, the dust and cobwebs, were among the\\nmost prominent decorations of the office of Mr Sampson Brass.', 'But this was mere still-life, of no greater importance than the plate,\\n‘BRASS, Solicitor,’ upon the door, and the bill, ‘First floor to let to\\na single gentleman,’ which was tied to the knocker.', 'The office\\ncommonly held two examples of animated nature, more to the purpose of\\nthis history, and in whom it has a stronger interest and more\\nparticular concern.', 'Of these, one was Mr Brass himself, who has already appeared in these\\npages.', 'The other was his clerk, assistant, housekeeper, secretary,\\nconfidential plotter, adviser, intriguer, and bill of cost increaser,\\nMiss Brass--a kind of amazon at common law, of whom it may be desirable\\nto offer a brief description.', 'Miss Sally Brass, then, was a lady of thirty-five or thereabouts, of a\\ngaunt and bony figure, and a resolute bearing, which if it repressed\\nthe softer emotions of love, and kept admirers at a distance, certainly\\ninspired a feeling akin to awe in the breasts of those male strangers\\nwho had the happiness to approach her.', 'In face she bore a striking\\nresemblance to her brother, Sampson--so exact, indeed, was the likeness\\nbetween them, that had it consorted with Miss Brass’s maiden modesty\\nand gentle womanhood to have assumed her brother’s clothes in a frolic\\nand sat down beside him, it would have been difficult for the oldest\\nfriend of the family to determine which was Sampson and which Sally,\\nespecially as the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish\\ndemonstrations, which, if the imagination had been assisted by her\\nattire, might have been mistaken for a beard.', 'These were, however, in\\nall probability, nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place, as the\\neyes of Miss Brass were quite free from any such natural\\nimpertinencies.', 'In complexion Miss Brass was sallow--rather a dirty\\nsallow, so to speak--but this hue was agreeably relieved by the healthy\\nglow which mantled in the extreme tip of her laughing nose.', 'Her voice\\nwas exceedingly impressive--deep and rich in quality, and, once heard,\\nnot easily forgotten.', 'Her usual dress was a green gown, in colour not\\nunlike the curtain of the office window, made tight to the figure, and\\nterminating at the throat, where it was fastened behind by a peculiarly\\nlarge and massive button.', 'Feeling, no doubt, that simplicity and\\nplainness are the soul of elegance, Miss Brass wore no collar or\\nkerchief except upon her head, which was invariably ornamented with a\\nbrown gauze scarf, like the wing of the fabled vampire, and which,\\ntwisted into any form that happened to suggest itself, formed an easy\\nand graceful head-dress.', 'Such was Miss Brass in person.', 'In mind, she was of a strong and\\nvigorous turn, having from her earliest youth devoted herself with\\nuncommon ardour to the study of law; not wasting her speculations upon\\nits eagle flights, which are rare, but tracing it attentively through\\nall the slippery and eel-like crawlings in which it commonly pursues\\nits way.', 'Nor had she, like many persons of great intellect, confined\\nherself to theory, or stopped short where practical usefulness begins;\\ninasmuch as she could ingross, fair-copy, fill up printed forms with\\nperfect accuracy, and, in short, transact any ordinary duty of the\\noffice down to pouncing a skin of parchment or mending a pen.', 'It is\\ndifficult to understand how, possessed of these combined attractions,\\nshe should remain Miss Brass; but whether she had steeled her heart\\nagainst mankind, or whether those who might have wooed and won her,\\nwere deterred by fears that, being learned in the law, she might have\\ntoo near her fingers’ ends those particular statutes which regulate\\nwhat are familiarly termed actions for breach, certain it is that she\\nwas still in a state of celibacy, and still in daily occupation of her\\nold stool opposite to that of her brother Sampson.', 'And equally certain\\nit is, by the way, that between these two stools a great many people\\nhad come to the ground.', 'One morning Mr Sampson Brass sat upon his stool copying some legal\\nprocess, and viciously digging his pen deep into the paper, as if he\\nwere writing upon the very heart of the party against whom it was\\ndirected; and Miss Sally Brass sat upon her stool making a new pen\\npreparatory to drawing out a little bill, which was her favourite\\noccupation; and so they sat in silence for a long time, until Miss\\nBrass broke silence.', '‘Have you nearly done, Sammy?’ said Miss Brass; for in her mild and\\nfeminine lips, Sampson became Sammy, and all things were softened down.', '‘No,’ returned her brother.', '‘It would have been all done though, if\\nyou had helped at the right time.’\\n\\n‘Oh yes, indeed,’ cried Miss Sally; ‘you want my help, don’t you?--YOU,\\ntoo, that are going to keep a clerk!’\\n\\n‘Am I going to keep a clerk for my own pleasure, or because of my own\\nwish, you provoking rascal!’ said Mr Brass, putting his pen in his\\nmouth, and grinning spitefully at his sister.', '‘What do you taunt me\\nabout going to keep a clerk for?’\\n\\nIt may be observed in this place, lest the fact of Mr Brass calling a\\nlady a rascal, should occasion any wonderment or surprise, that he was\\nso habituated to having her near him in a man’s capacity, that he had\\ngradually accustomed himself to talk to her as though she were really a\\nman.', 'And this feeling was so perfectly reciprocal, that not only did\\nMr Brass often call Miss Brass a rascal, or even put an adjective\\nbefore the rascal, but Miss Brass looked upon it as quite a matter of\\ncourse, and was as little moved as any other lady would be by being\\ncalled an angel.', '‘What do you taunt me, after three hours’ talk last night, with going\\nto keep a clerk for?’ repeated Mr Brass, grinning again with the pen in\\nhis mouth, like some nobleman’s or gentleman’s crest.', '‘Is it my fault?’\\n\\n‘All I know is,’ said Miss Sally, smiling drily, for she delighted in\\nnothing so much as irritating her brother, ‘that if every one of your\\nclients is to force us to keep a clerk, whether we want to or not, you\\nhad better leave off business, strike yourself off the roll, and get\\ntaken in execution, as soon as you can.’\\n\\n‘Have we got any other client like him?’ said Brass.', '‘Have we got\\nanother client like him now--will you answer me that?’\\n\\n‘Do you mean in the face!’ said his sister.', '‘Do I mean in the face!’ sneered Sampson Brass, reaching over to take\\nup the bill-book, and fluttering its leaves rapidly.', '‘Look\\nhere--Daniel Quilp, Esquire--Daniel Quilp, Esquire--Daniel Quilp,\\nEsquire--all through.', 'Whether should I take a clerk that he\\nrecommends, and says, “this is the man for you,” or lose all this, eh?’\\n\\nMiss Sally deigned to make no reply, but smiled again, and went on with\\nher work.', '‘But I know what it is,’ resumed Brass after a short silence.', '‘You’re\\nafraid you won’t have as long a finger in the business as you’ve been\\nused to have.', 'Do you think I don’t see through that?’\\n\\n‘The business wouldn’t go on very long, I expect, without me,’ returned\\nhis sister composedly.', '‘Don’t you be a fool and provoke me, Sammy, but\\nmind what you’re doing, and do it.’\\n\\nSampson Brass, who was at heart in great fear of his sister, sulkily\\nbent over his writing again, and listened as she said:\\n\\n‘If I determined that the clerk ought not to come, of course he\\nwouldn’t be allowed to come.', 'You know that well enough, so don’t talk\\nnonsense.’\\n\\nMr Brass received this observation with increased meekness, merely\\nremarking, under his breath, that he didn’t like that kind of joking,\\nand that Miss Sally would be ‘a much better fellow’ if she forbore to\\naggravate him.', 'To this compliment Miss Sally replied, that she had a\\nrelish for the amusement, and had no intention to forego its\\ngratification.', 'Mr Brass not caring, as it seemed, to pursue the\\nsubject any further, they both plied their pens at a great pace, and\\nthere the discussion ended.', 'While they were thus employed, the window was suddenly darkened, as by\\nsome person standing close against it.', 'As Mr Brass and Miss Sally\\nlooked up to ascertain the cause, the top sash was nimbly lowered from\\nwithout, and Quilp thrust in his head.', '‘Hallo!’ he said, standing on tip-toe on the window-sill, and looking\\ndown into the room.', '‘Is there anybody at home?', 'Is there any of the\\nDevil’s ware here?', 'Is Brass at a premium, eh?’\\n\\n‘Ha, ha, ha!’ laughed the lawyer in an affected ecstasy.', '‘Oh, very\\ngood, Sir!', 'Oh, very good indeed!', 'Quite eccentric!', 'Dear me, what\\nhumour he has!’\\n\\n‘Is that my Sally?’ croaked the dwarf, ogling the fair Miss Brass.', '‘Is\\nit Justice with the bandage off her eyes, and without the sword and\\nscales?', 'Is it the Strong Arm of the Law?', 'Is it the Virgin of Bevis?’\\n\\n‘What an amazing flow of spirits!’ cried Brass.', '‘Upon my word, it’s\\nquite extraordinary!’\\n\\n‘Open the door,’ said Quilp, ‘I’ve got him here.', 'Such a clerk for you,\\nBrass, such a prize, such an ace of trumps.', 'Be quick and open the\\ndoor, or if there’s another lawyer near and he should happen to look\\nout of window, he’ll snap him up before your eyes, he will.’\\n\\nIt is probable that the loss of the phoenix of clerks, even to a rival\\npractitioner, would not have broken Mr Brass’s heart; but, pretending\\ngreat alacrity, he rose from his seat, and going to the door, returned,\\nintroducing his client, who led by the hand no less a person than Mr\\nRichard Swiveller.', '‘There she is,’ said Quilp, stopping short at the door, and wrinkling\\nup his eyebrows as he looked towards Miss Sally; ‘there is the woman I\\nought to have married--there is the beautiful Sarah--there is the\\nfemale who has all the charms of her sex and none of their weaknesses.', 'Oh Sally, Sally!’\\n\\nTo this amorous address Miss Brass briefly responded ‘Bother!’\\n\\n‘Hard-hearted as the metal from which she takes her name,’ said Quilp.', '‘Why don’t she change it--melt down the brass, and take another name?’\\n\\n‘Hold your nonsense, Mr Quilp, do,’ returned Miss Sally, with a grim\\nsmile.', '‘I wonder you’re not ashamed of yourself before a strange young\\nman.’\\n\\n‘The strange young man,’ said Quilp, handing Dick Swiveller forward,\\n‘is too susceptible himself not to understand me well.', 'This is Mr\\nSwiveller, my intimate friend--a gentleman of good family and great\\nexpectations, but who, having rather involved himself by youthful\\nindiscretion, is content for a time to fill the humble station of a\\nclerk--humble, but here most enviable.', 'What a delicious atmosphere!’\\n\\nIf Mr Quilp spoke figuratively, and meant to imply that the air\\nbreathed by Miss Sally Brass was sweetened and rarefied by that dainty\\ncreature, he had doubtless good reason for what he said.', 'But if he\\nspoke of the delights of the atmosphere of Mr Brass’s office in a\\nliteral sense, he had certainly a peculiar taste, as it was of a close\\nand earthy kind, and, besides being frequently impregnated with strong\\nwhiffs of the second-hand wearing apparel exposed for sale in Duke’s\\nPlace and Houndsditch, had a decided flavour of rats and mice, and a\\ntaint of mouldiness.', 'Perhaps some doubts of its pure delight presented\\nthemselves to Mr Swiveller, as he gave vent to one or two short abrupt\\nsniffs, and looked incredulously at the grinning dwarf.', '‘Mr Swiveller,’ said Quilp, ‘being pretty well accustomed to the\\nagricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats, Miss Sally, prudently\\nconsiders that half a loaf is better than no bread.', 'To be out of\\nharm’s way he prudently thinks is something too, and therefore he\\naccepts your brother’s offer.', 'Brass, Mr Swiveller is yours.’\\n\\n‘I am very glad, Sir,’ said Mr Brass, ‘very glad indeed.', 'Mr Swiveller,\\nSir, is fortunate enough to have your friendship.', 'You may be very\\nproud, Sir, to have the friendship of Mr Quilp.’\\n\\nDick murmured something about never wanting a friend or a bottle to\\ngive him, and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of\\nfriendship and its never moulting a feather; but his faculties appeared\\nto be absorbed in the contemplation of Miss Sally Brass, at whom he\\nstared with blank and rueful looks, which delighted the watchful dwarf\\nbeyond measure.', 'As to the divine Miss Sally herself, she rubbed her\\nhands as men of business do, and took a few turns up and down the\\noffice with her pen behind her ear.', '‘I suppose,’ said the dwarf, turning briskly to his legal friend, ‘that\\nMr Swiveller enters upon his duties at once?', 'It’s Monday morning.’\\n\\n‘At once, if you please, Sir, by all means,’ returned Brass.', '‘Miss Sally will teach him law, the delightful study of the law,’ said\\nQuilp; ‘she’ll be his guide, his friend, his companion, his Blackstone,\\nhis Coke upon Littleton, his Young Lawyer’s Best Companion.’\\n\\n‘He is exceedingly eloquent,’ said Brass, like a man abstracted, and\\nlooking at the roofs of the opposite houses, with his hands in his\\npockets; ‘he has an extraordinary flow of language.', 'Beautiful, really.’\\n\\n‘With Miss Sally,’ Quilp went on, ‘and the beautiful fictions of the\\nlaw, his days will pass like minutes.', 'Those charming creations of the\\npoet, John Doe and Richard Roe, when they first dawn upon him, will\\nopen a new world for the enlargement of his mind and the improvement of\\nhis heart.’\\n\\n‘Oh, beautiful, beautiful!', 'Beau-ti-ful indeed!’ cried Brass.', '‘It’s a\\ntreat to hear him!’\\n\\n‘Where will Mr Swiveller sit?’ said Quilp, looking round.', '‘Why, we’ll buy another stool, sir,’ returned Brass.', '‘We hadn’t any\\nthoughts of having a gentleman with us, sir, until you were kind enough\\nto suggest it, and our accommodation’s not extensive.', 'We’ll look about\\nfor a second-hand stool, sir.', 'In the meantime, if Mr Swiveller will\\ntake my seat, and try his hand at a fair copy of this ejectment, as I\\nshall be out pretty well all the morning--’\\n\\n‘Walk with me,’ said Quilp.', '‘I have a word or two to say to you on\\npoints of business.', 'Can you spare the time?’\\n\\n‘Can I spare the time to walk with you, sir?', 'You’re joking, sir,\\nyou’re joking with me,’ replied the lawyer, putting on his hat.', '‘I’m\\nready, sir, quite ready.', 'My time must be fully occupied indeed, sir,\\nnot to leave me time to walk with you.', 'It’s not everybody, sir, who\\nhas an opportunity of improving himself by the conversation of Mr\\nQuilp.’\\n\\nThe dwarf glanced sarcastically at his brazen friend, and, with a short\\ndry cough, turned upon his heel to bid adieu to Miss Sally.', 'After a\\nvery gallant parting on his side, and a very cool and gentlemanly sort\\nof one on hers, he nodded to Dick Swiveller, and withdrew with the\\nattorney.', 'Dick stood at the desk in a state of utter stupefaction, staring with\\nall his might at the beauteous Sally, as if she had been some curious\\nanimal whose like had never lived.', 'When the dwarf got into the street,\\nhe mounted again upon the window-sill, and looked into the office for a\\nmoment with a grinning face, as a man might peep into a cage.', 'Dick\\nglanced upward at him, but without any token of recognition; and long\\nafter he had disappeared, still stood gazing upon Miss Sally Brass,\\nseeing or thinking of nothing else, and rooted to the spot.', 'Miss Brass being by this time deep in the bill of costs, took no notice\\nwhatever of Dick, but went scratching on, with a noisy pen, scoring\\ndown the figures with evident delight, and working like a steam-engine.', 'There stood Dick, gazing now at the green gown, now at the brown\\nhead-dress, now at the face, and now at the rapid pen, in a state of\\nstupid perplexity, wondering how he got into the company of that\\nstrange monster, and whether it was a dream and he would ever wake.', 'At\\nlast he heaved a deep sigh, and began slowly pulling off his coat.', 'Mr Swiveller pulled off his coat, and folded it up with great\\nelaboration, staring at Miss Sally all the time; then put on a blue\\njacket with a double row of gilt buttons, which he had originally\\nordered for aquatic expeditions, but had brought with him that morning\\nfor office purposes; and, still keeping his eye upon her, suffered\\nhimself to drop down silently upon Mr Brass’s stool.', 'Then he underwent\\na relapse, and becoming powerless again, rested his chin upon his hand,\\nand opened his eyes so wide, that it appeared quite out of the question\\nthat he could ever close them any more.', 'When he had looked so long that he could see nothing, Dick took his\\neyes off the fair object of his amazement, turned over the leaves of\\nthe draft he was to copy, dipped his pen into the inkstand, and at\\nlast, and by slow approaches, began to write.', 'But he had not written\\nhalf-a-dozen words when, reaching over to the inkstand to take a fresh\\ndip, he happened to raise his eyes.', 'There was the intolerable brown\\nhead-dress--there was the green gown--there, in short, was Miss Sally\\nBrass, arrayed in all her charms, and more tremendous than ever.', 'This happened so often, that Mr Swiveller by degrees began to feel\\nstrange influences creeping over him--horrible desires to annihilate\\nthis Sally Brass--mysterious promptings to knock her head-dress off and\\ntry how she looked without it.', 'There was a very large ruler on the\\ntable; a large, black, shining ruler.', 'Mr Swiveller took it up and\\nbegan to rub his nose with it.', 'From rubbing his nose with the ruler, to poising it in his hand and\\ngiving it an occasional flourish after the tomahawk manner, the\\ntransition was easy and natural.', 'In some of these flourishes it went\\nclose to Miss Sally’s head; the ragged edges of the head-dress\\nfluttered with the wind it raised; advance it but an inch, and that\\ngreat brown knot was on the ground: yet still the unconscious maiden\\nworked away, and never raised her eyes.', 'Well, this was a great relief.', 'It was a good thing to write doggedly\\nand obstinately until he was desperate, and then snatch up the ruler\\nand whirl it about the brown head-dress with the consciousness that he\\ncould have it off if he liked.', 'It was a good thing to draw it back,\\nand rub his nose very hard with it, if he thought Miss Sally was going\\nto look up, and to recompense himself with more hardy flourishes when\\nhe found she was still absorbed.', 'By these means Mr Swiveller calmed\\nthe agitation of his feelings, until his applications to the ruler\\nbecame less fierce and frequent, and he could even write as many as\\nhalf-a-dozen consecutive lines without having recourse to it--which was\\na great victory.', 'CHAPTER 34\\n\\nIn course of time, that is to say, after a couple of hours or so, of\\ndiligent application, Miss Brass arrived at the conclusion of her task,\\nand recorded the fact by wiping her pen upon the green gown, and taking\\na pinch of snuff from a little round tin box which she carried in her\\npocket.', 'Having disposed of this temperate refreshment, she arose from\\nher stool, tied her papers into a formal packet with red tape, and\\ntaking them under her arm, marched out of the office.', 'Mr Swiveller had scarcely sprung off his seat and commenced the\\nperformance of a maniac hornpipe, when he was interrupted, in the\\nfulness of his joy at being again alone, by the opening of the door,\\nand the reappearance of Miss Sally’s head.', '‘I am going out,’ said Miss Brass.', '‘Very good, ma’am,’ returned Dick.', '‘And don’t hurry yourself on my\\naccount to come back, ma’am,’ he added inwardly.', '‘If anybody comes on office business, take their messages, and say that\\nthe gentleman who attends to that matter isn’t in at present, will\\nyou?’ said Miss Brass.', '‘I will, ma’am,’ replied Dick.', '‘I shan’t be very long,’ said Miss Brass, retiring.', '‘I’m sorry to hear it, ma’am,’ rejoined Dick when she had shut the\\ndoor.', '‘I hope you may be unexpectedly detained, ma’am.', 'If you could\\nmanage to be run over, ma’am, but not seriously, so much the better.’\\n\\nUttering these expressions of good-will with extreme gravity, Mr\\nSwiveller sat down in the client’s chair and pondered; then took a few\\nturns up and down the room and fell into the chair again.', '‘So I’m Brass’s clerk, am I?’ said Dick.', '‘Brass’s clerk, eh?', 'And the\\nclerk of Brass’s sister--clerk to a female Dragon.', 'Very good, very\\ngood!', 'What shall I be next?', 'Shall I be a convict in a felt hat and a\\ngrey suit, trotting about a dockyard with my number neatly embroidered\\non my uniform, and the order of the garter on my leg, restrained from\\nchafing my ankle by a twisted belcher handkerchief?', 'Shall I be that?', 'Will that do, or is it too genteel?', 'Whatever you please, have it your\\nown way, of course.’\\n\\nAs he was entirely alone, it may be presumed that, in these remarks, Mr\\nSwiveller addressed himself to his fate or destiny, whom, as we learn\\nby the precedents, it is the custom of heroes to taunt in a very bitter\\nand ironical manner when they find themselves in situations of an\\nunpleasant nature.', 'This is the more probable from the circumstance of\\nMr Swiveller directing his observations to the ceiling, which these\\nbodily personages are usually supposed to inhabit--except in theatrical\\ncases, when they live in the heart of the great chandelier.', '‘Quilp offers me this place, which he says he can insure me,’ resumed\\nDick after a thoughtful silence, and telling off the circumstances of\\nhis position, one by one, upon his fingers; ‘Fred, who, I could have\\ntaken my affidavit, would not have heard of such a thing, backs Quilp\\nto my astonishment, and urges me to take it also--staggerer, number\\none!', 'My aunt in the country stops the supplies, and writes an\\naffectionate note to say that she has made a new will, and left me out\\nof it--staggerer, number two.', 'No money; no credit; no support from\\nFred, who seems to turn steady all at once; notice to quit the old\\nlodgings--staggerers, three, four, five, and six!', 'Under an\\naccumulation of staggerers, no man can be considered a free agent.', 'No\\nman knocks himself down; if his destiny knocks him down, his destiny\\nmust pick him up again.', 'Then I’m very glad that mine has brought all\\nthis upon itself, and I shall be as careless as I can, and make myself\\nquite at home to spite it.', 'So go on my buck,’ said Mr Swiveller,\\ntaking his leave of the ceiling with a significant nod, ‘and let us see\\nwhich of us will be tired first!’\\n\\nDismissing the subject of his downfall with these reflections, which\\nwere no doubt very profound, and are indeed not altogether unknown in\\ncertain systems of moral philosophy, Mr Swiveller shook off his\\ndespondency and assumed the cheerful ease of an irresponsible clerk.', 'As a means towards his composure and self-possession, he entered into a\\nmore minute examination of the office than he had yet had time to make;\\nlooked into the wig-box, the books, and ink-bottle; untied and\\ninspected all the papers; carved a few devices on the table with a\\nsharp blade of Mr Brass’s penknife; and wrote his name on the inside of\\nthe wooden coal-scuttle.', 'Having, as it were, taken formal possession\\nof his clerkship in virtue of these proceedings, he opened the window\\nand leaned negligently out of it until a beer-boy happened to pass,\\nwhom he commanded to set down his tray and to serve him with a pint of\\nmild porter, which he drank upon the spot and promptly paid for, with\\nthe view of breaking ground for a system of future credit and opening a\\ncorrespondence tending thereto, without loss of time.', 'Then, three or\\nfour little boys dropped in, on legal errands from three or four\\nattorneys of the Brass grade: whom Mr Swiveller received and dismissed\\nwith about as professional a manner, and as correct and comprehensive\\nan understanding of their business, as would have been shown by a clown\\nin a pantomime under similar circumstances.', 'These things done and\\nover, he got upon his stool again and tried his hand at drawing\\ncaricatures of Miss Brass with a pen and ink, whistling very cheerfully\\nall the time.', 'He was occupied in this diversion when a coach stopped near the door,\\nand presently afterwards there was a loud double-knock.', 'As this was no\\nbusiness of Mr Swiveller’s, the person not ringing the office bell, he\\npursued his diversion with perfect composure, notwithstanding that he\\nrather thought there was nobody else in the house.', 'In this, however, he was mistaken; for, after the knock had been\\nrepeated with increased impatience, the door was opened, and somebody\\nwith a very heavy tread went up the stairs and into the room above.', 'Mr\\nSwiveller was wondering whether this might be another Miss Brass, twin\\nsister to the Dragon, when there came a rapping of knuckles at the\\noffice door.', '‘Come in!’ said Dick.', '‘Don’t stand upon ceremony.', 'The business will\\nget rather complicated if I’ve many more customers.', 'Come in!’\\n\\n‘Oh, please,’ said a little voice very low down in the doorway, ‘will\\nyou come and show the lodgings?’\\n\\nDick leant over the table, and descried a small slipshod girl in a\\ndirty coarse apron and bib, which left nothing of her visible but her\\nface and feet.', 'She might as well have been dressed in a violin-case.', '‘Why, who are you?’ said Dick.', 'To which the only reply was, ‘Oh, please will you come and show the\\nlodgings?’\\n\\nThere never was such an old-fashioned child in her looks and manner.', 'She must have been at work from her cradle.', 'She seemed as much afraid\\nof Dick, as Dick was amazed at her.', '‘I hav’n’t got anything to do with the lodgings,’ said Dick.', '‘Tell ‘em\\nto call again.’\\n\\n‘Oh, but please will you come and show the lodgings,’ returned the\\ngirl; ‘It’s eighteen shillings a week and us finding plate and linen.', 'Boots and clothes is extra, and fires in winter-time is eightpence a\\nday.’\\n\\n‘Why don’t you show ‘em yourself?', 'You seem to know all about ‘em,’\\nsaid Dick.', '‘Miss Sally said I wasn’t to, because people wouldn’t believe the\\nattendance was good if they saw how small I was first.’\\n\\n‘Well, but they’ll see how small you are afterwards, won’t they?’ said\\nDick.', '‘Ah!', 'But then they’ll have taken ‘em for a fortnight certain,’ replied\\nthe child with a shrewd look; ‘and people don’t like moving when\\nthey’re once settled.’\\n\\n‘This is a queer sort of thing,’ muttered Dick, rising.', '‘What do you\\nmean to say you are--the cook?’\\n\\n‘Yes, I do plain cooking;’ replied the child.', '‘I’m housemaid too; I do\\nall the work of the house.’\\n\\n‘I suppose Brass and the Dragon and I do the dirtiest part of it,’\\nthought Dick.', 'And he might have thought much more, being in a doubtful\\nand hesitating mood, but that the girl again urged her request, and\\ncertain mysterious bumping sounds on the passage and staircase seemed\\nto give note of the applicant’s impatience.', 'Richard Swiveller,\\ntherefore, sticking a pen behind each ear, and carrying another in his\\nmouth as a token of his great importance and devotion to business,\\nhurried out to meet and treat with the single gentleman.', 'He was a little surprised to perceive that the bumping sounds were\\noccasioned by the progress up-stairs of the single gentleman’s trunk,\\nwhich, being nearly twice as wide as the staircase, and exceedingly\\nheavy withal, it was no easy matter for the united exertions of the\\nsingle gentleman and the coachman to convey up the steep ascent.', 'But\\nthere they were, crushing each other, and pushing and pulling with all\\ntheir might, and getting the trunk tight and fast in all kinds of\\nimpossible angles, and to pass them was out of the question; for which\\nsufficient reason, Mr Swiveller followed slowly behind, entering a new\\nprotest on every stair against the house of Mr Sampson Brass being thus\\ntaken by storm.', 'To these remonstrances, the single gentleman answered not a word, but\\nwhen the trunk was at last got into the bed-room, sat down upon it and\\nwiped his bald head and face with his handkerchief.', 'He was very warm,\\nand well he might be; for, not to mention the exertion of getting the\\ntrunk up stairs, he was closely muffled in winter garments, though the\\nthermometer had stood all day at eighty-one in the shade.', '‘I believe, sir,’ said Richard Swiveller, taking his pen out of his\\nmouth, ‘that you desire to look at these apartments.', 'They are very\\ncharming apartments, sir.', 'They command an uninterrupted view of--of\\nover the way, and they are within one minute’s walk of--of the corner\\nof the street.', 'There is exceedingly mild porter, sir, in the immediate\\nvicinity, and the contingent advantages are extraordinary.’\\n\\n‘What’s the rent?’ said the single gentleman.', '‘One pound per week,’ replied Dick, improving on the terms.', '‘I’ll take ‘em.’\\n\\n‘The boots and clothes are extras,’ said Dick; ‘and the fires in winter\\ntime are--’\\n\\n‘Are all agreed to,’ answered the single gentleman.', '‘Two weeks certain,’ said Dick, ‘are the--’\\n\\n‘Two weeks!’ cried the single gentleman gruffly, eyeing him from top to\\ntoe.', '‘Two years.', 'I shall live here for two years.', 'Here.', 'Ten pounds\\ndown.', 'The bargain’s made.’\\n\\n‘Why you see,’ said Dick, ‘my name is not Brass, and--’\\n\\n‘Who said it was?', 'My name’s not Brass.', 'What then?’\\n\\n‘The name of the master of the house is,’ said Dick.', '‘I’m glad of it,’ returned the single gentleman; ‘it’s a good name for\\na lawyer.', 'Coachman, you may go.', 'So may you, Sir.’\\n\\nMr Swiveller was so much confounded by the single gentleman riding\\nroughshod over him at this rate, that he stood looking at him almost as\\nhard as he had looked at Miss Sally.', 'The single gentleman, however,\\nwas not in the slightest degree affected by this circumstance, but\\nproceeded with perfect composure to unwind the shawl which was tied\\nround his neck, and then to pull off his boots.', 'Freed of these\\nencumbrances, he went on to divest himself of his other clothing, which\\nhe folded up, piece by piece, and ranged in order on the trunk.', 'Then,\\nhe pulled down the window-blinds, drew the curtains, wound up his\\nwatch, and, quite leisurely and methodically, got into bed.', '‘Take down the bill,’ were his parting words, as he looked out from\\nbetween the curtains; ‘and let nobody call me till I ring the bell.’\\n\\nWith that the curtains closed, and he seemed to snore immediately.', '‘This is a most remarkable and supernatural sort of house!’ said Mr\\nSwiveller, as he walked into the office with the bill in his hand.', '‘She-dragons in the business, conducting themselves like professional\\ngentlemen; plain cooks of three feet high appearing mysteriously from\\nunder ground; strangers walking in and going to bed without leave or\\nlicence in the middle of the day!', 'If he should be one of the\\nmiraculous fellows that turn up now and then, and has gone to sleep for\\ntwo years, I shall be in a pleasant situation.', 'It’s my destiny,\\nhowever, and I hope Brass may like it.', 'I shall be sorry if he don’t.', 'But it’s no business of mine--I have nothing whatever to do with it!’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 35\\n\\nMr Brass on returning home received the report of his clerk with much\\ncomplacency and satisfaction, and was particular in inquiring after the\\nten-pound note, which, proving on examination to be a good and lawful\\nnote of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, increased his\\ngood-humour considerably.', 'Indeed he so overflowed with liberality and\\ncondescension, that, in the fulness of his heart, he invited Mr\\nSwiveller to partake of a bowl of punch with him at that remote and\\nindefinite period which is currently denominated ‘one of these days,’\\nand paid him many handsome compliments on the uncommon aptitude for\\nbusiness which his conduct on the first day of his devotion to it had\\nso plainly evinced.', 'It was a maxim with Mr Brass that the habit of paying compliments kept\\na man’s tongue oiled without any expense; and, as that useful member\\nought never to grow rusty or creak in turning on its hinges in the case\\nof a practitioner of the law, in whom it should be always glib and\\neasy, he lost few opportunities of improving himself by the utterance\\nof handsome speeches and eulogistic expressions.', 'And this had passed\\ninto such a habit with him, that, if he could not be correctly said to\\nhave his tongue at his fingers’ ends, he might certainly be said to\\nhave it anywhere but in his face: which being, as we have already seen,\\nof a harsh and repulsive character, was not oiled so easily, but\\nfrowned above all the smooth speeches--one of nature’s beacons, warning\\noff those who navigated the shoals and breakers of the World, or of\\nthat dangerous strait the Law, and admonishing them to seek less\\ntreacherous harbours and try their fortune elsewhere.', 'While Mr Brass by turns overwhelmed his clerk with compliments and\\ninspected the ten-pound note, Miss Sally showed little emotion and that\\nof no pleasurable kind, for as the tendency of her legal practice had\\nbeen to fix her thoughts on small gains and gripings, and to whet and\\nsharpen her natural wisdom, she was not a little disappointed that the\\nsingle gentleman had obtained the lodgings at such an easy rate,\\narguing that when he was seen to have set his mind upon them, he should\\nhave been at the least charged double or treble the usual terms, and\\nthat, in exact proportion as he pressed forward, Mr Swiveller should\\nhave hung back.', 'But neither the good opinion of Mr Brass, nor the\\ndissatisfaction of Miss Sally, wrought any impression upon that young\\ngentleman, who, throwing the responsibility of this and all other acts\\nand deeds thereafter to be done by him, upon his unlucky destiny, was\\nquite resigned and comfortable: fully prepared for the worst, and\\nphilosophically indifferent to the best.', '‘Good morning, Mr Richard,’ said Brass, on the second day of Mr\\nSwiveller’s clerkship.', '‘Sally found you a second-hand stool, Sir,\\nyesterday evening, in Whitechapel.', 'She’s a rare fellow at a bargain, I\\ncan tell you, Mr Richard.', 'You’ll find that a first-rate stool, Sir,\\ntake my word for it.’\\n\\n‘It’s rather a crazy one to look at,’ said Dick.', '‘You’ll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon, you may depend,’\\nreturned Mr Brass.', '‘It was bought in the open street just opposite the\\nhospital, and as it has been standing there a month of two, it has got\\nrather dusty and a little brown from being in the sun, that’s all.’\\n\\n‘I hope it hasn’t got any fevers or anything of that sort in it,’ said\\nDick, sitting himself down discontentedly, between Mr Sampson and the\\nchaste Sally.', '‘One of the legs is longer than the others.’\\n\\n‘Then we get a bit of timber in, Sir,’ retorted Brass.', '‘Ha, ha, ha!', 'We get a bit of timber in, Sir, and that’s another advantage of my\\nsister’s going to market for us.', 'Miss Brass, Mr Richard is the--’\\n\\n‘Will you keep quiet?’ interrupted the fair subject of these remarks,\\nlooking up from her papers.', '‘How am I to work if you keep on\\nchattering?’\\n\\n‘What an uncertain chap you are!’ returned the lawyer.', '‘Sometimes\\nyou’re all for a chat.', 'At another time you’re all for work.', 'A man\\nnever knows what humour he’ll find you in.’\\n\\n‘I’m in a working humour now,’ said Sally, ‘so don’t disturb me, if you\\nplease.', 'And don’t take him,’ Miss Sally pointed with the feather of\\nher pen to Richard, ‘off his business.', 'He won’t do more than he can\\nhelp, I dare say.’\\n\\nMr Brass had evidently a strong inclination to make an angry reply, but\\nwas deterred by prudent or timid considerations, as he only muttered\\nsomething about aggravation and a vagabond; not associating the terms\\nwith any individual, but mentioning them as connected with some\\nabstract ideas which happened to occur to him.', 'They went on writing\\nfor a long time in silence after this--in such a dull silence that Mr\\nSwiveller (who required excitement) had several times fallen asleep,\\nand written divers strange words in an unknown character with his eyes\\nshut, when Miss Sally at length broke in upon the monotony of the\\noffice by pulling out the little tin box, taking a noisy pinch of\\nsnuff, and then expressing her opinion that Mr Richard Swiveller had\\n‘done it.’\\n\\n‘Done what, ma’am?’ said Richard.', '‘Do you know,’ returned Miss Brass, ‘that the lodger isn’t up yet--\\nthat nothing has been seen or heard of him since he went to bed\\nyesterday afternoon?’\\n\\n‘Well, ma’am,’ said Dick, ‘I suppose he may sleep his ten pound out, in\\npeace and quietness, if he likes.’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'I begin to think he’ll never wake,’ observed Miss Sally.', '‘It’s a very remarkable circumstance,’ said Brass, laying down his pen;\\n‘really, very remarkable.', 'Mr Richard, you’ll remember, if this\\ngentleman should be found to have hung himself to the bed-post, or any\\nunpleasant accident of that kind should happen--you’ll remember, Mr\\nRichard, that this ten pound note was given to you in part payment of\\ntwo years’ rent?', 'You’ll bear that in mind, Mr Richard; you had better\\nmake a note of it, sir, in case you should ever be called upon to give\\nevidence.’\\n\\nMr Swiveller took a large sheet of foolscap, and with a countenance of\\nprofound gravity, began to make a very small note in one corner.', '‘We can never be too cautious,’ said Mr Brass.', '‘There is a deal of\\nwickedness going about the world, a deal of wickedness.', 'Did the\\ngentleman happen to say, Sir--but never mind that at present, sir;\\nfinish that little memorandum first.’\\n\\nDick did so, and handed it to Mr Brass, who had dismounted from his\\nstool, and was walking up and down the office.', '‘Oh, this is the memorandum, is it?’ said Brass, running his eye over\\nthe document.', '‘Very good.', 'Now, Mr Richard, did the gentleman say\\nanything else?’\\n\\n‘No.’\\n\\n‘Are you sure, Mr Richard,’ said Brass, solemnly, ‘that the gentleman\\nsaid nothing else?’\\n\\n‘Devil a word, Sir,’ replied Dick.', '‘Think again, Sir,’ said Brass; ‘it’s my duty, Sir, in the position in\\nwhich I stand, and as an honourable member of the legal profession--the\\nfirst profession in this country, Sir, or in any other country, or in\\nany of the planets that shine above us at night and are supposed to be\\ninhabited--it’s my duty, Sir, as an honourable member of that\\nprofession, not to put to you a leading question in a matter of this\\ndelicacy and importance.', 'Did the gentleman, Sir, who took the first\\nfloor of you yesterday afternoon, and who brought with him a box of\\nproperty--a box of property--say anything more than is set down in this\\nmemorandum?’\\n\\n‘Come, don’t be a fool,’ said Miss Sally.', 'Dick looked at her, and then at Brass, and then at Miss Sally again,\\nand still said ‘No.’\\n\\n‘Pooh, pooh!', 'Deuce take it, Mr Richard, how dull you are!’ cried\\nBrass, relaxing into a smile.', '‘Did he say anything about his\\nproperty?--there!’\\n\\n‘That’s the way to put it,’ said Miss Sally, nodding to her brother.', '‘Did he say, for instance,’ added Brass, in a kind of comfortable, cozy\\ntone--‘I don’t assert that he did say so, mind; I only ask you, to\\nrefresh your memory--did he say, for instance, that he was a stranger\\nin London--that it was not his humour or within his ability to give any\\nreferences--that he felt we had a right to require them--and that, in\\ncase anything should happen to him, at any time, he particularly\\ndesired that whatever property he had upon the premises should be\\nconsidered mine, as some slight recompense for the trouble and\\nannoyance I should sustain--and were you, in short,’ added Brass, still\\nmore comfortably and cozily than before, ‘were you induced to accept\\nhim on my behalf, as a tenant, upon those conditions?’\\n\\n‘Certainly not,’ replied Dick.', '‘Why then, Mr Richard,’ said Brass, darting at him a supercilious and\\nreproachful look, ‘it’s my opinion that you’ve mistaken your calling,\\nand will never make a lawyer.’\\n\\n‘Not if you live a thousand years,’ added Miss Sally.', 'Whereupon the\\nbrother and sister took each a noisy pinch of snuff from the little tin\\nbox, and fell into a gloomy thoughtfulness.', 'Nothing further passed up to Mr Swiveller’s dinner-time, which was at\\nthree o’clock, and seemed about three weeks in coming.', 'At the first\\nstroke of the hour, the new clerk disappeared.', 'At the last stroke of\\nfive, he reappeared, and the office, as if by magic, became fragrant\\nwith the smell of gin and water and lemon-peel.', '‘Mr Richard,’ said Brass, ‘this man’s not up yet.', 'Nothing will wake\\nhim, sir.', 'What’s to be done?’\\n\\n‘I should let him have his sleep out,’ returned Dick.', '‘Sleep out!’ cried Brass; ‘why he has been asleep now, six-and-twenty\\nhours.', 'We have been moving chests of drawers over his head, we have\\nknocked double knocks at the street-door, we have made the servant-girl\\nfall down stairs several times (she’s a light weight, and it don’t hurt\\nher much,) but nothing wakes him.’\\n\\n‘Perhaps a ladder,’ suggested Dick, ‘and getting in at the first-floor\\nwindow--’\\n\\n‘But then there’s a door between; besides, the neighbours would be up\\nin arms,’ said Brass.', '‘What do you say to getting on the roof of the house through the\\ntrap-door, and dropping down the chimney?’ suggested Dick.', '‘That would be an excellent plan,’ said Brass, ‘if anybody would be--’\\nand here he looked very hard at Mr Swiveller--‘would be kind, and\\nfriendly, and generous enough, to undertake it.', 'I dare say it would\\nnot be anything like as disagreeable as one supposes.’\\n\\nDick had made the suggestion, thinking that the duty might possibly\\nfall within Miss Sally’s department.', 'As he said nothing further, and\\ndeclined taking the hint, Mr Brass was fain to propose that they should\\ngo up stairs together, and make a last effort to awaken the sleeper by\\nsome less violent means, which, if they failed on this last trial, must\\npositively be succeeded by stronger measures.', 'Mr Swiveller, assenting,\\narmed himself with his stool and the large ruler, and repaired with his\\nemployer to the scene of action, where Miss Brass was already ringing a\\nhand-bell with all her might, and yet without producing the smallest\\neffect upon their mysterious lodger.', '‘There are his boots, Mr Richard!’ said Brass.', '‘Very obstinate-looking articles they are too,’ quoth Richard\\nSwiveller.', 'And truly, they were as sturdy and bluff a pair of boots as\\none would wish to see; as firmly planted on the ground as if their\\nowner’s legs and feet had been in them; and seeming, with their broad\\nsoles and blunt toes, to hold possession of their place by main force.', '‘I can’t see anything but the curtain of the bed,’ said Brass, applying\\nhis eye to the keyhole of the door.', '‘Is he a strong man, Mr Richard?’\\n\\n‘Very,’ answered Dick.', '‘It would be an extremely unpleasant circumstance if he was to bounce\\nout suddenly,’ said Brass.', '‘Keep the stairs clear.', 'I should be more\\nthan a match for him, of course, but I’m the master of the house, and\\nthe laws of hospitality must be respected.--Hallo there!', 'Hallo, hallo!’\\n\\nWhile Mr Brass, with his eye curiously twisted into the keyhole,\\nuttered these sounds as a means of attracting the lodger’s attention,\\nand while Miss Brass plied the hand-bell, Mr Swiveller put his stool\\nclose against the wall by the side of the door, and mounting on the top\\nand standing bolt upright, so that if the lodger did make a rush, he\\nwould most probably pass him in its onward fury, began a violent\\nbattery with the ruler upon the upper panels of the door.', 'Captivated\\nwith his own ingenuity, and confident in the strength of his position,\\nwhich he had taken up after the method of those hardy individuals who\\nopen the pit and gallery doors of theatres on crowded nights, Mr\\nSwiveller rained down such a shower of blows, that the noise of the\\nbell was drowned; and the small servant, who lingered on the stairs\\nbelow, ready to fly at a moment’s notice, was obliged to hold her ears\\nlest she should be rendered deaf for life.', 'Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside, and flung violently open.', 'The small servant flew to the coal-cellar; Miss Sally dived into her\\nown bed-room; Mr Brass, who was not remarkable for personal courage,\\nran into the next street, and finding that nobody followed him, armed\\nwith a poker or other offensive weapon, put his hands in his pockets,\\nwalked very slowly all at once, and whistled.', 'Meanwhile, Mr Swiveller, on the top of the stool, drew himself into as\\nflat a shape as possible against the wall, and looked, not\\nunconcernedly, down upon the single gentleman, who appeared at the door\\ngrowling and cursing in a very awful manner, and, with the boots in his\\nhand, seemed to have an intention of hurling them down stairs on\\nspeculation.', 'This idea, however, he abandoned.', 'He was turning into\\nhis room again, still growling vengefully, when his eyes met those of\\nthe watchful Richard.', '‘Have YOU been making that horrible noise?’ said the single gentleman.', '‘I have been helping, sir,’ returned Dick, keeping his eye upon him,\\nand waving the ruler gently in his right hand, as an indication of what\\nthe single gentleman had to expect if he attempted any violence.', '‘How dare you then,’ said the lodger, ‘Eh?’\\n\\nTo this, Dick made no other reply than by inquiring whether the lodger\\nheld it to be consistent with the conduct and character of a gentleman\\nto go to sleep for six-and-twenty hours at a stretch, and whether the\\npeace of an amiable and virtuous family was to weigh as nothing in the\\nbalance.', '‘Is my peace nothing?’ said the single gentleman.', '‘Is their peace nothing, sir?’ returned Dick.', '‘I don’t wish to hold\\nout any threats, sir--indeed the law does not allow of threats, for to\\nthreaten is an indictable offence--but if ever you do that again, take\\ncare you’re not sat upon by the coroner and buried in a cross road\\nbefore you wake.', 'We have been distracted with fears that you were\\ndead, Sir,’ said Dick, gently sliding to the ground, ‘and the short and\\nthe long of it is, that we cannot allow single gentlemen to come into\\nthis establishment and sleep like double gentlemen without paying extra\\nfor it.’\\n\\n‘Indeed!’ cried the lodger.', '‘Yes, Sir, indeed,’ returned Dick, yielding to his destiny and saying\\nwhatever came uppermost; ‘an equal quantity of slumber was never got\\nout of one bed and bedstead, and if you’re going to sleep in that way,\\nyou must pay for a double-bedded room.’\\n\\nInstead of being thrown into a greater passion by these remarks, the\\nlodger lapsed into a broad grin and looked at Mr Swiveller with\\ntwinkling eyes.', 'He was a brown-faced sun-burnt man, and appeared\\nbrowner and more sun-burnt from having a white nightcap on.', 'As it was\\nclear that he was a choleric fellow in some respects, Mr Swiveller was\\nrelieved to find him in such good humour, and, to encourage him in it,\\nsmiled himself.', 'The lodger, in the testiness of being so rudely roused, had pushed his\\nnightcap very much on one side of his bald head.', 'This gave him a\\nrakish eccentric air which, now that he had leisure to observe it,\\ncharmed Mr Swiveller exceedingly; therefore, by way of propitiation, he\\nexpressed his hope that the gentleman was going to get up, and further\\nthat he would never do so any more.', '‘Come here, you impudent rascal!’ was the lodger’s answer as he\\nre-entered his room.', 'Mr Swiveller followed him in, leaving the stool outside, but reserving\\nthe ruler in case of a surprise.', 'He rather congratulated himself on\\nhis prudence when the single gentleman, without notice or explanation\\nof any kind, double-locked the door.', '‘Can you drink anything?’ was his next inquiry.', 'Mr Swiveller replied that he had very recently been assuaging the pangs\\nof thirst, but that he was still open to ‘a modest quencher,’ if the\\nmaterials were at hand.', 'Without another word spoken on either side,\\nthe lodger took from his great trunk, a kind of temple, shining as of\\npolished silver, and placed it carefully on the table.', 'Greatly interested in his proceedings, Mr Swiveller observed him\\nclosely.', 'Into one little chamber of this temple, he dropped an egg;\\ninto another some coffee; into a third a compact piece of raw steak\\nfrom a neat tin case; into a fourth, he poured some water.', 'Then, with\\nthe aid of a phosphorus-box and some matches, he procured a light and\\napplied it to a spirit-lamp which had a place of its own below the\\ntemple; then, he shut down the lids of all the little chambers; then he\\nopened them; and then, by some wonderful and unseen agency, the steak\\nwas done, the egg was boiled, the coffee was accurately prepared, and\\nhis breakfast was ready.', '‘Hot water--’ said the lodger, handing it to Mr Swiveller with as much\\ncoolness as if he had a kitchen fire before him--‘extraordinary\\nrum--sugar--and a travelling glass.', 'Mix for yourself.', 'And make haste.’\\n\\nDick complied, his eyes wandering all the time from the temple on the\\ntable, which seemed to do everything, to the great trunk which seemed\\nto hold everything.', 'The lodger took his breakfast like a man who was\\nused to work these miracles, and thought nothing of them.', '‘The man of the house is a lawyer, is he not?’ said the lodger.', 'Dick nodded.', 'The rum was amazing.', '‘The woman of the house--what’s she?’\\n\\n‘A dragon,’ said Dick.', 'The single gentleman, perhaps because he had met with such things in\\nhis travels, or perhaps because he WAS a single gentleman, evinced no\\nsurprise, but merely inquired ‘Wife or sister?’--‘Sister,’ said\\nDick.--‘So much the better,’ said the single gentleman, ‘he can get rid\\nof her when he likes.’\\n\\n‘I want to do as I like, young man,’ he added after a short silence;\\n‘to go to bed when I like, get up when I like, come in when I like, go\\nout when I like--to be asked no questions and be surrounded by no\\nspies.', 'In this last respect, servants are the devil.', 'There’s only one\\nhere.’\\n\\n‘And a very little one,’ said Dick.', '‘And a very little one,’ repeated the lodger.', '‘Well, the place will\\nsuit me, will it?’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Dick.', '‘Sharks, I suppose?’ said the lodger.', 'Dick nodded assent, and drained his glass.', '‘Let them know my humour,’ said the single gentleman, rising.', '‘If they\\ndisturb me, they lose a good tenant.', 'If they know me to be that, they\\nknow enough.', 'If they try to know more, it’s a notice to quit.', 'It’s\\nbetter to understand these things at once.', 'Good day.’\\n\\n‘I beg your pardon,’ said Dick, halting in his passage to the door,\\nwhich the lodger prepared to open.', '‘When he who adores thee has left\\nbut the name--’\\n\\n‘What do you mean?’\\n\\n‘--But the name,’ said Dick--‘has left but the name--in case of letters\\nor parcels--’\\n\\n‘I never have any,’ returned the lodger.', '‘Or in the case anybody should call.’\\n\\n‘Nobody ever calls on me.’\\n\\n‘If any mistake should arise from not having the name, don’t say it was\\nmy fault, Sir,’ added Dick, still lingering.--‘Oh blame not the bard--’\\n\\n‘I’ll blame nobody,’ said the lodger, with such irascibility that in a\\nmoment Dick found himself on the staircase, and the locked door between\\nthem.', 'Mr Brass and Miss Sally were lurking hard by, having been, indeed, only\\nrouted from the keyhole by Mr Swiveller’s abrupt exit.', 'As their utmost\\nexertions had not enabled them to overhear a word of the interview,\\nhowever, in consequence of a quarrel for precedence, which, though\\nlimited of necessity to pushes and pinches and such quiet pantomime,\\nhad lasted the whole time, they hurried him down to the office to hear\\nhis account of the conversation.', 'This Mr Swiveller gave them--faithfully as regarded the wishes and\\ncharacter of the single gentleman, and poetically as concerned the\\ngreat trunk, of which he gave a description more remarkable for\\nbrilliancy of imagination than a strict adherence to truth; declaring,\\nwith many strong asseverations, that it contained a specimen of every\\nkind of rich food and wine, known in these times, and in particular\\nthat it was of a self-acting kind and served up whatever was required,\\nas he supposed by clock-work.', 'He also gave them to understand that the\\ncooking apparatus roasted a fine piece of sirloin of beef, weighing\\nabout six pounds avoir-dupoise, in two minutes and a quarter, as he had\\nhimself witnessed, and proved by his sense of taste; and further, that,\\nhowever the effect was produced, he had distinctly seen water boil and\\nbubble up when the single gentleman winked; from which facts he (Mr\\nSwiveller) was led to infer that the lodger was some great conjuror or\\nchemist, or both, whose residence under that roof could not fail at\\nsome future days to shed a great credit and distinction on the name of\\nBrass, and add a new interest to the history of Bevis Marks.', 'There was one point which Mr Swiveller deemed it unnecessary to enlarge\\nupon, and that was the fact of the modest quencher, which, by reason of\\nits intrinsic strength and its coming close upon the heels of the\\ntemperate beverage he had discussed at dinner, awakened a slight degree\\nof fever, and rendered necessary two or three other modest quenchers at\\nthe public-house in the course of the evening.', 'CHAPTER 36\\n\\nAs the single gentleman after some weeks’ occupation of his lodgings,\\nstill declined to correspond, by word or gesture, either with Mr Brass\\nor his sister Sally, but invariably chose Richard Swiveller as his\\nchannel of communication; and as he proved himself in all respects a\\nhighly desirable inmate, paying for everything beforehand, giving very\\nlittle trouble, making no noise, and keeping early hours; Mr Richard\\nimperceptibly rose to an important position in the family, as one who\\nhad influence over this mysterious lodger, and could negotiate with\\nhim, for good or evil, when nobody else durst approach his person.', 'If the truth must be told, even Mr Swiveller’s approaches to the single\\ngentleman were of a very distant kind, and met with small\\nencouragement; but, as he never returned from a monosyllabic conference\\nwith the unknown, without quoting such expressions as ‘Swiveller, I\\nknow I can rely upon you,’--‘I have no hesitation in saying, Swiveller,\\nthat I entertain a regard for you,’--‘Swiveller, you are my friend, and\\nwill stand by me I am sure,’ with many other short speeches of the same\\nfamiliar and confiding kind, purporting to have been addressed by the\\nsingle gentleman to himself, and to form the staple of their ordinary\\ndiscourse, neither Mr Brass nor Miss Sally for a moment questioned the\\nextent of his influence, but accorded to him their fullest and most\\nunqualified belief.', 'But quite apart from, and independent of, this source of popularity, Mr\\nSwiveller had another, which promised to be equally enduring, and to\\nlighten his position considerably.', 'He found favour in the eyes of Miss Sally Brass.', 'Let not the light\\nscorners of female fascination erect their ears to listen to a new tale\\nof love which shall serve them for a jest; for Miss Brass, however\\naccurately formed to be beloved, was not of the loving kind.', 'That\\namiable virgin, having clung to the skirts of the Law from her earliest\\nyouth; having sustained herself by their aid, as it were, in her first\\nrunning alone, and maintained a firm grasp upon them ever since; had\\npassed her life in a kind of legal childhood.', 'She had been remarkable,\\nwhen a tender prattler for an uncommon talent in counterfeiting the\\nwalk and manner of a bailiff: in which character she had learned to tap\\nher little playfellows on the shoulder, and to carry them off to\\nimaginary sponging-houses, with a correctness of imitation which was\\nthe surprise and delight of all who witnessed her performances, and\\nwhich was only to be exceeded by her exquisite manner of putting an\\nexecution into her doll’s house, and taking an exact inventory of the\\nchairs and tables.', 'These artless sports had naturally soothed and\\ncheered the decline of her widowed father: a most exemplary gentleman\\n(called ‘old Foxey’ by his friends from his extreme sagacity,) who\\nencouraged them to the utmost, and whose chief regret, on finding that\\nhe drew near to Houndsditch churchyard, was, that his daughter could\\nnot take out an attorney’s certificate and hold a place upon the roll.', 'Filled with this affectionate and touching sorrow, he had solemnly\\nconfided her to his son Sampson as an invaluable auxiliary; and from\\nthe old gentleman’s decease to the period of which we treat, Miss Sally\\nBrass had been the prop and pillar of his business.', 'It is obvious that, having devoted herself from infancy to this one\\npursuit and study, Miss Brass could know but little of the world,\\notherwise than in connection with the law; and that from a lady gifted\\nwith such high tastes, proficiency in those gentler and softer arts in\\nwhich women usually excel, was scarcely to be looked for.', 'Miss Sally’s\\naccomplishments were all of a masculine and strictly legal kind.', 'They\\nbegan with the practice of an attorney and they ended with it.', 'She was\\nin a state of lawful innocence, so to speak.', 'The law had been her\\nnurse.', 'And, as bandy-legs or such physical deformities in children are\\nheld to be the consequence of bad nursing, so, if in a mind so\\nbeautiful any moral twist or handiness could be found, Miss Sally\\nBrass’s nurse was alone to blame.', 'It was upon this lady, then, that Mr Swiveller burst in full freshness as\\nsomething new and hitherto undreamed of, lighting up the office with\\nscraps of song and merriment, conjuring with inkstands and boxes of\\nwafers, catching three oranges in one hand, balancing stools upon his\\nchin and penknives on his nose, and constantly performing a hundred\\nother feats with equal ingenuity; for with such unbendings did Richard,\\nin Mr Brass’s absence, relieve the tedium of his confinement.', 'These\\nsocial qualities, which Miss Sally first discovered by accident,\\ngradually made such an impression upon her, that she would entreat Mr\\nSwiveller to relax as though she were not by, which Mr Swiveller,\\nnothing loth, would readily consent to do.', 'By these means a friendship\\nsprung up between them.', 'Mr Swiveller gradually came to look upon her\\nas her brother Sampson did, and as he would have looked upon any other\\nclerk.', 'He imparted to her the mystery of going the odd man or plain\\nNewmarket for fruit, ginger-beer, baked potatoes, or even a modest\\nquencher, of which Miss Brass did not scruple to partake.', 'He would\\noften persuade her to undertake his share of writing in addition to her\\nown; nay, he would sometimes reward her with a hearty slap on the back,\\nand protest that she was a devilish good fellow, a jolly dog, and so\\nforth; all of which compliments Miss Sally would receive in entire good\\npart and with perfect satisfaction.', 'One circumstance troubled Mr Swiveller’s mind very much, and that was\\nthat the small servant always remained somewhere in the bowels of the\\nearth under Bevis Marks, and never came to the surface unless the\\nsingle gentleman rang his bell, when she would answer it and\\nimmediately disappear again.', 'She never went out, or came into the\\noffice, or had a clean face, or took off the coarse apron, or looked\\nout of any one of the windows, or stood at the street-door for a breath\\nof air, or had any rest or enjoyment whatever.', 'Nobody ever came to see\\nher, nobody spoke of her, nobody cared about her.', 'Mr Brass had said\\nonce, that he believed she was a ‘love-child’ (which means anything but\\na child of love), and that was all the information Richard Swiveller\\ncould obtain.', '‘It’s of no use asking the dragon,’ thought Dick one day, as he sat\\ncontemplating the features of Miss Sally Brass.', '‘I suspect if I asked\\nany questions on that head, our alliance would be at an end.', 'I wonder\\nwhether she is a dragon by-the-bye, or something in the mermaid way.', 'She has rather a scaly appearance.', 'But mermaids are fond of looking at\\nthemselves in the glass, which she can’t be.', 'And they have a habit of\\ncombing their hair, which she hasn’t.', 'No, she’s a dragon.’\\n\\n‘Where are you going, old fellow?’ said Dick aloud, as Miss Sally wiped\\nher pen as usual on the green dress, and uprose from her seat.', '‘To dinner,’ answered the dragon.', '‘To dinner!’ thought Dick, ‘that’s another circumstance.', 'I don’t\\nbelieve that small servant ever has anything to eat.’\\n\\n‘Sammy won’t be home,’ said Miss Brass.', '‘Stop till I come back.', 'I\\nsha’n’t be long.’\\n\\nDick nodded, and followed Miss Brass--with his eyes to the door, and\\nwith his ears to a little back parlour, where she and her brother took\\ntheir meals.', '‘Now,’ said Dick, walking up and down with his hands in his pockets,\\n‘I’d give something--if I had it--to know how they use that child, and\\nwhere they keep her.', 'My mother must have been a very inquisitive\\nwoman; I have no doubt I’m marked with a note of interrogation\\nsomewhere.', 'My feelings I smother, but thou hast been the cause of this\\nanguish, my--upon my word,’ said Mr Swiveller, checking himself and\\nfalling thoughtfully into the client’s chair, ‘I should like to know\\nhow they use her!’\\n\\nAfter running on, in this way, for some time, Mr Swiveller softly\\nopened the office door, with the intention of darting across the street\\nfor a glass of the mild porter.', 'At that moment he caught a parting\\nglimpse of the brown head-dress of Miss Brass flitting down the kitchen\\nstairs.', '‘And by Jove!’ thought Dick, ‘she’s going to feed the small\\nservant.', 'Now or never!’\\n\\nFirst peeping over the handrail and allowing the head-dress to\\ndisappear in the darkness below, he groped his way down, and arrived at\\nthe door of a back kitchen immediately after Miss Brass had entered the\\nsame, bearing in her hand a cold leg of mutton.', 'It was a very dark\\nmiserable place, very low and very damp: the walls disfigured by a\\nthousand rents and blotches.', 'The water was trickling out of a leaky\\nbutt, and a most wretched cat was lapping up the drops with the sickly\\neagerness of starvation.', 'The grate, which was a wide one, was wound\\nand screwed up tight, so as to hold no more than a little thin sandwich\\nof fire.', 'Everything was locked up; the coal-cellar, the candle-box,\\nthe salt-box, the meat-safe, were all padlocked.', 'There was nothing\\nthat a beetle could have lunched upon.', 'The pinched and meagre aspect\\nof the place would have killed a chameleon.', 'He would have known, at\\nthe first mouthful, that the air was not eatable, and must have given up\\nthe ghost in despair.', 'The small servant stood with humility in presence\\nof Miss Sally, and hung her head.', '‘Are you there?’ said Miss Sally.', '‘Yes, ma’am,’ was the answer in a weak voice.', '‘Go further away from the leg of mutton, or you’ll be picking it, I\\nknow,’ said Miss Sally.', 'The girl withdrew into a corner, while Miss Brass took a key from her\\npocket, and opening the safe, brought from it a dreary waste of cold\\npotatoes, looking as eatable as Stonehenge.', 'This she placed before the\\nsmall servant, ordering her to sit down before it, and then, taking up\\na great carving-knife, made a mighty show of sharpening it upon the\\ncarving-fork.', '‘Do you see this?’ said Miss Brass, slicing off about two square inches\\nof cold mutton, after all this preparation, and holding it out on the\\npoint of the fork.', 'The small servant looked hard enough at it with her hungry eyes to see\\nevery shred of it, small as it was, and answered, ‘yes.’\\n\\n‘Then don’t you ever go and say,’ retorted Miss Sally, ‘that you hadn’t\\nmeat here.', 'There, eat it up.’\\n\\nThis was soon done.', '‘Now, do you want any more?’ said Miss Sally.', 'The hungry creature answered with a faint ‘No.’  They were evidently\\ngoing through an established form.', '‘You’ve been helped once to meat,’ said Miss Brass, summing up the\\nfacts; ‘you have had as much as you can eat, you’re asked if you want\\nany more, and you answer, ‘no!’ Then don’t you ever go and say you were\\nallowanced, mind that.’\\n\\nWith those words, Miss Sally put the meat away and locked the safe, and\\nthen drawing near to the small servant, overlooked her while she\\nfinished the potatoes.', 'It was plain that some extraordinary grudge was working in Miss Brass’s\\ngentle breast, and that it was that which impelled her, without the\\nsmallest present cause, to rap the child with the blade of the knife,\\nnow on her hand, now on her head, and now on her back, as if she found\\nit quite impossible to stand so close to her without administering a\\nfew slight knocks.', 'But Mr Swiveller was not a little surprised to see\\nhis fellow-clerk, after walking slowly backwards towards the door, as\\nif she were trying to withdraw herself from the room but could not\\naccomplish it, dart suddenly forward, and falling on the small servant\\ngive her some hard blows with her clenched hand.', 'The victim cried, but\\nin a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice, and Miss\\nSally, comforting herself with a pinch of snuff, ascended the stairs,\\njust as Richard had safely reached the office.', 'CHAPTER 37\\n\\nThe single gentleman among his other peculiarities--and he had a very\\nplentiful stock, of which he every day furnished some new\\nspecimen--took a most extraordinary and remarkable interest in the\\nexhibition of Punch.', 'If the sound of a Punch’s voice, at ever so\\nremote a distance, reached Bevis Marks, the single gentleman, though in\\nbed and asleep, would start up, and, hurrying on his clothes, make for\\nthe spot with all speed, and presently return at the head of a long\\nprocession of idlers, having in the midst the theatre and its\\nproprietors.', 'Straightway, the stage would be set up in front of Mr\\nBrass’s house; the single gentleman would establish himself at the\\nfirst floor window; and the entertainment would proceed, with all its\\nexciting accompaniments of fife and drum and shout, to the excessive\\nconsternation of all sober votaries of business in that silent\\nthoroughfare.', 'It might have been expected that when the play was done,\\nboth players and audience would have dispersed; but the epilogue was as\\nbad as the play, for no sooner was the Devil dead, than the manager of\\nthe puppets and his partner were summoned by the single gentleman to\\nhis chamber, where they were regaled with strong waters from his\\nprivate store, and where they held with him long conversations, the\\npurport of which no human being could fathom.', 'But the secret of these\\ndiscussions was of little importance.', 'It was sufficient to know that\\nwhile they were proceeding, the concourse without still lingered round\\nthe house; that boys beat upon the drum with their fists, and imitated\\nPunch with their tender voices; that the office-window was rendered\\nopaque by flattened noses, and the key-hole of the street-door luminous\\nwith eyes; that every time the single gentleman or either of his guests\\nwas seen at the upper window, or so much as the end of one of their\\nnoses was visible, there was a great shout of execration from the\\nexcluded mob, who remained howling and yelling, and refusing\\nconsolation, until the exhibitors were delivered up to them to be\\nattended elsewhere.', 'It was sufficient, in short, to know that Bevis\\nMarks was revolutionised by these popular movements, and that peace and\\nquietness fled from its precincts.', 'Nobody was rendered more indignant by these proceedings than Mr Sampson\\nBrass, who, as he could by no means afford to lose so profitable an\\ninmate, deemed it prudent to pocket his lodger’s affront along with his\\ncash, and to annoy the audiences who clustered round his door by such\\nimperfect means of retaliation as were open to him, and which were\\nconfined to the trickling down of foul water on their heads from unseen\\nwatering pots, pelting them with fragments of tile and mortar from the\\nroof of the house, and bribing the drivers of hackney cabriolets to\\ncome suddenly round the corner and dash in among them precipitately.', 'It may, at first sight, be matter of surprise to the thoughtless few\\nthat Mr Brass, being a professional gentleman, should not have legally\\nindicted some party or parties, active in the promotion of the\\nnuisance, but they will be good enough to remember, that as Doctors\\nseldom take their own prescriptions, and Divines do not always practise\\nwhat they preach, so lawyers are shy of meddling with the Law on their\\nown account: knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application,\\nvery expensive in the working, and rather remarkable for its properties\\nof close shaving, than for its always shaving the right person.', '‘Come,’ said Mr Brass one afternoon, ‘this is two days without a Punch.', 'I’m in hopes he has run through ‘em all, at last.’\\n\\n‘Why are you in hopes?’ returned Miss Sally.', '‘What harm do they do?’\\n\\n‘Here’s a pretty sort of a fellow!’ cried Brass, laying down his pen in\\ndespair.', '‘Now here’s an aggravating animal!’\\n\\n‘Well, what harm do they do?’ retorted Sally.', '‘What harm!’ cried Brass.', '‘Is it no harm to have a constant hallooing\\nand hooting under one’s very nose, distracting one from business, and\\nmaking one grind one’s teeth with vexation?', 'Is it no harm to be\\nblinded and choked up, and have the king’s highway stopped with a set\\nof screamers and roarers whose throats must be made of--of--’\\n\\n‘Brass,’ suggested Mr Swiveller.', '‘Ah!', 'of brass,’ said the lawyer, glancing at his clerk, to assure\\nhimself that he had suggested the word in good faith and without any\\nsinister intention.', '‘Is that no harm?’\\n\\nThe lawyer stopped short in his invective, and listening for a moment,\\nand recognising the well-known voice, rested his head upon his hand,\\nraised his eyes to the ceiling, and muttered faintly, ‘There’s another!’\\n\\nUp went the single gentleman’s window directly.', '‘There’s another,’ repeated Brass; ‘and if I could get a break and four\\nblood horses to cut into the Marks when the crowd is at its thickest,\\nI’d give eighteen-pence and never grudge it!’\\n\\nThe distant squeak was heard again.', 'The single gentleman’s door burst\\nopen.', 'He ran violently down the stairs, out into the street, and so\\npast the window, without any hat, towards the quarter whence the sound\\nproceeded--bent, no doubt, upon securing the strangers’ services\\ndirectly.', '‘I wish I only knew who his friends were,’ muttered Sampson, filling\\nhis pocket with papers; ‘if they’d just get up a pretty little\\nCommission de lunatico at the Gray’s Inn Coffee House and give me the\\njob, I’d be content to have the lodgings empty for one while, at all\\nevents.’\\n\\nWith which words, and knocking his hat over his eyes as if for the\\npurpose of shutting out even a glimpse of the dreadful visitation, Mr\\nBrass rushed from the house and hurried away.', 'As Mr Swiveller was decidedly favourable to these performances, upon\\nthe ground that looking at a Punch, or indeed looking at anything out\\nof window, was better than working; and as he had been, for this\\nreason, at some pains to awaken in his fellow clerk a sense of their\\nbeauties and manifold deserts; both he and Miss Sally rose as with one\\naccord and took up their positions at the window: upon the sill\\nwhereof, as in a post of honour, sundry young ladies and gentlemen who\\nwere employed in the dry nurture of babies, and who made a point of\\nbeing present, with their young charges, on such occasions, had already\\nestablished themselves as comfortably as the circumstances would allow.', 'The glass being dim, Mr Swiveller, agreeably to a friendly custom which\\nhe had established between them, hitched off the brown head-dress from\\nMiss Sally’s head, and dusted it carefully therewith.', 'By the time he\\nhad handed it back, and its beautiful wearer had put it on again (which\\nshe did with perfect composure and indifference), the lodger returned\\nwith the show and showmen at his heels, and a strong addition to the\\nbody of spectators.', 'The exhibitor disappeared with all speed behind\\nthe drapery; and his partner, stationing himself by the side of the\\nTheatre, surveyed the audience with a remarkable expression of\\nmelancholy, which became more remarkable still when he breathed a\\nhornpipe tune into that sweet musical instrument which is popularly\\ntermed a mouth-organ, without at all changing the mournful expression\\nof the upper part of his face, though his mouth and chin were, of\\nnecessity, in lively spasms.', 'The drama proceeded to its close, and held the spectators enchained in\\nthe customary manner.', 'The sensation which kindles in large assemblies,\\nwhen they are relieved from a state of breathless suspense and are\\nagain free to speak and move, was yet rife, when the lodger, as usual,\\nsummoned the men up stairs.', '‘Both of you,’ he called from the window; for only the actual\\nexhibitor--a little fat man--prepared to obey the summons.', '‘I want to\\ntalk to you.', 'Come both of you!’\\n\\n‘Come, Tommy,’ said the little man.', '‘I an’t a talker,’ replied the other.', '‘Tell him so.', 'What should I go\\nand talk for?’\\n\\n‘Don’t you see the gentleman’s got a bottle and glass up there?’\\nreturned the little man.', '‘And couldn’t you have said so at first?’ retorted the other with\\nsudden alacrity.', '‘Now, what are you waiting for?', 'Are you going to\\nkeep the gentleman expecting us all day?', 'haven’t you no manners?’\\n\\nWith this remonstrance, the melancholy man, who was no other than Mr\\nThomas Codlin, pushed past his friend and brother in the craft, Mr\\nHarris, otherwise Short or Trotters, and hurried before him to the\\nsingle gentleman’s apartment.', '‘Now, my men,’ said the single gentleman; ‘you have done very well.', 'What will you take?', 'Tell that little man behind, to shut the door.’\\n\\n‘Shut the door, can’t you?’ said Mr Codlin, turning gruffly to his\\nfriend.', '‘You might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door\\nshut, without being told, I think.’\\n\\nMr Short obeyed, observing under his breath that his friend seemed\\nunusually ‘cranky,’ and expressing a hope that there was no dairy in\\nthe neighbourhood, or his temper would certainly spoil its contents.', 'The gentleman pointed to a couple of chairs, and intimated by an\\nemphatic nod of his head that he expected them to be seated.', 'Messrs\\nCodlin and Short, after looking at each other with considerable doubt\\nand indecision, at length sat down--each on the extreme edge of the\\nchair pointed out to him--and held their hats very tight, while the\\nsingle gentleman filled a couple of glasses from a bottle on the table\\nbeside him, and presented them in due form.', '‘You’re pretty well browned by the sun, both of you,’ said their\\nentertainer.', '‘Have you been travelling?’\\n\\nMr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile.', 'Mr Codlin\\nadded a corroborative nod and a short groan, as if he still felt the\\nweight of the Temple on his shoulders.', '‘To fairs, markets, races, and so forth, I suppose?’ pursued the single\\ngentleman.', '‘Yes, sir,’ returned Short, ‘pretty nigh all over the West of England.’\\n\\n‘I have talked to men of your craft from North, East, and South,’\\nreturned their host, in rather a hasty manner; ‘but I never lighted on\\nany from the West before.’\\n\\n‘It’s our reg’lar summer circuit is the West, master,’ said Short;\\n‘that’s where it is.', 'We takes the East of London in the spring and\\nwinter, and the West of England in the summer time.', 'Many’s the hard\\nday’s walking in rain and mud, and with never a penny earned, we’ve had\\ndown in the West.’\\n\\n‘Let me fill your glass again.’\\n\\n‘Much obleeged to you sir, I think I will,’ said Mr Codlin, suddenly\\nthrusting in his own and turning Short’s aside.', '‘I’m the sufferer,\\nsir, in all the travelling, and in all the staying at home.', 'In town or\\ncountry, wet or dry, hot or cold, Tom Codlin suffers.', 'But Tom Codlin\\nisn’t to complain for all that.', 'Oh, no!', 'Short may complain, but if\\nCodlin grumbles by so much as a word--oh dear, down with him, down\\nwith him directly.', 'It isn’t his place to grumble.', 'That’s quite out of\\nthe question.’\\n\\n‘Codlin an’t without his usefulness,’ observed Short with an arch look,\\n‘but he don’t always keep his eyes open.', 'He falls asleep sometimes,\\nyou know.', 'Remember them last races, Tommy.’\\n\\n‘Will you never leave off aggravating a man?’ said Codlin.', '‘It’s very\\nlike I was asleep when five-and-tenpence was collected, in one round,\\nisn’t it?', 'I was attending to my business, and couldn’t have my eyes in\\ntwenty places at once, like a peacock, no more than you could.', 'If I\\nan’t a match for an old man and a young child, you an’t neither, so\\ndon’t throw that out against me, for the cap fits your head quite as\\ncorrect as it fits mine.’\\n\\n‘You may as well drop the subject, Tom,’ said Short.', '‘It isn’t\\nparticular agreeable to the gentleman, I dare say.’\\n\\n‘Then you shouldn’t have brought it up,’ returned Mr Codlin; ‘and I ask\\nthe gentleman’s pardon on your account, as a giddy chap that likes to\\nhear himself talk, and don’t much care what he talks about, so that he\\ndoes talk.’\\n\\nTheir entertainer had sat perfectly quiet in the beginning of this\\ndispute, looking first at one man and then at the other, as if he were\\nlying in wait for an opportunity of putting some further question, or\\nreverting to that from which the discourse had strayed.', 'But, from the\\npoint where Mr Codlin was charged with sleepiness, he had shown an\\nincreasing interest in the discussion: which now attained a very high\\npitch.', '‘You are the two men I want,’ he said, ‘the two men I have been looking\\nfor, and searching after!', 'Where are that old man and that child you\\nspeak of?’\\n\\n‘Sir?’ said Short, hesitating, and looking towards his friend.', '‘The old man and his grandchild who travelled with you--where are they?', 'It will be worth your while to speak out, I assure you; much better\\nworth your while than you believe.', 'They left you, you say--at those\\nraces, as I understand.', 'They have been traced to that place, and there\\nlost sight of.', 'Have you no clue, can you suggest no clue, to their\\nrecovery?’\\n\\n‘Did I always say, Thomas,’ cried Short, turning with a look of\\namazement to his friend, ‘that there was sure to be an inquiry after\\nthem two travellers?’\\n\\n‘YOU said!’ returned Mr Codlin.', '‘Did I always say that that ‘ere\\nblessed child was the most interesting I ever see?', 'Did I always say I\\nloved her, and doated on her?', 'Pretty creetur, I think I hear her now.', '“Codlin’s my friend,” she says, with a tear of gratitude a trickling\\ndown her little eye; “Codlin’s my friend,” she says--“not Short.', 'Short’s very well,” she says; “I’ve no quarrel with Short; he means\\nkind, I dare say; but Codlin,” she says, “has the feelings for my\\nmoney, though he mayn’t look it.”’\\n\\nRepeating these words with great emotion, Mr Codlin rubbed the bridge\\nof his nose with his coat-sleeve, and shaking his head mournfully from\\nside to side, left the single gentleman to infer that, from the moment\\nwhen he lost sight of his dear young charge, his peace of mind and\\nhappiness had fled.', '‘Good Heaven!’ said the single gentleman, pacing up and down the room,\\n‘have I found these men at last, only to discover that they can give me\\nno information or assistance!', 'It would have been better to have lived\\non, in hope, from day to day, and never to have lighted on them, than\\nto have my expectations scattered thus.’\\n\\n‘Stay a minute,’ said Short.', '‘A man of the name of Jerry--you know\\nJerry, Thomas?’\\n\\n‘Oh, don’t talk to me of Jerrys,’ replied Mr Codlin.', '‘How can I care a\\npinch of snuff for Jerrys, when I think of that ‘ere darling child?', '“Codlin’s my friend,” she says, “dear, good, kind Codlin, as is always\\na devising pleasures for me!', 'I don’t object to Short,” she says, “but\\nI cotton to Codlin.” Once,’ said that gentleman reflectively, ‘she\\ncalled me Father Codlin.', 'I thought I should have bust!’\\n\\n‘A man of the name of Jerry, sir,’ said Short, turning from his selfish\\ncolleague to their new acquaintance, ‘wot keeps a company of dancing\\ndogs, told me, in a accidental sort of way, that he had seen the old\\ngentleman in connexion with a travelling wax-work, unbeknown to him.', 'As they’d given us the slip, and nothing had come of it, and this was\\ndown in the country that he’d been seen, I took no measures about it,\\nand asked no questions--But I can, if you like.’\\n\\n‘Is this man in town?’ said the impatient single gentleman.', '‘Speak\\nfaster.’\\n\\n‘No he isn’t, but he will be to-morrow, for he lodges in our house,’\\nreplied Mr Short rapidly.', '‘Then bring him here,’ said the single gentleman.', '‘Here’s a sovereign\\na-piece.', 'If I can find these people through your means, it is but a\\nprelude to twenty more.', 'Return to me to-morrow, and keep your own\\ncounsel on this subject--though I need hardly tell you that; for you’ll\\ndo so for your own sakes.', 'Now, give me your address, and leave me.’\\n\\nThe address was given, the two men departed, the crowd went with them,\\nand the single gentleman for two mortal hours walked in uncommon\\nagitation up and down his room, over the wondering heads of Mr\\nSwiveller and Miss Sally Brass.', 'CHAPTER 38\\n\\nKit--for it happens at this juncture, not only that we have breathing\\ntime to follow his fortunes, but that the necessities of these\\nadventures so adapt themselves to our ease and inclination as to call\\nupon us imperatively to pursue the track we most desire to take--Kit,\\nwhile the matters treated of in the last fifteen chapters were yet in\\nprogress, was, as the reader may suppose, gradually familiarising\\nhimself more and more with Mr and Mrs Garland, Mr Abel, the pony, and\\nBarbara, and gradually coming to consider them one and all as his\\nparticular private friends, and Abel Cottage, Finchley, as his own\\nproper home.', 'Stay--the words are written, and may go, but if they convey any notion\\nthat Kit, in the plentiful board and comfortable lodging of his new\\nabode, began to think slightingly of the poor fare and furniture of his\\nold dwelling, they do their office badly and commit injustice.', 'Who so\\nmindful of those he left at home--albeit they were but a mother and two\\nyoung babies--as Kit?', 'What boastful father in the fulness of his heart\\never related such wonders of his infant prodigy, as Kit never wearied\\nof telling Barbara in the evening time, concerning little Jacob?', 'Was\\nthere ever such a mother as Kit’s mother, on her son’s showing; or was\\nthere ever such comfort in poverty as in the poverty of Kit’s family,\\nif any correct judgment might be arrived at, from his own glowing\\naccount!', 'And let me linger in this place, for an instant, to remark that if ever\\nhousehold affections and loves are graceful things, they are graceful\\nin the poor.', 'The ties that bind the wealthy and the proud to home may\\nbe forged on earth, but those which link the poor man to his humble\\nhearth are of the truer metal and bear the stamp of Heaven.', 'The man of\\nhigh descent may love the halls and lands of his inheritance as part of\\nhimself: as trophies of his birth and power; his associations with them\\nare associations of pride and wealth and triumph; the poor man’s\\nattachment to the tenements he holds, which strangers have held before,\\nand may to-morrow occupy again, has a worthier root, struck deep into a\\npurer soil.', 'His household gods are of flesh and blood, with no alloy\\nof silver, gold, or precious stone; he has no property but in the\\naffections of his own heart; and when they endear bare floors and\\nwalls, despite of rags and toil and scanty fare, that man has his love\\nof home from God, and his rude hut becomes a solemn place.', 'Oh!', 'if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember\\nthis--if they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have\\nengendered in their hearts, that love of home from which all domestic\\nvirtues spring, when they live in dense and squalid masses where social\\ndecency is lost, or rather never found--if they would but turn aside\\nfrom the wide thoroughfares and great houses, and strive to improve the\\nwretched dwellings in bye-ways where only Poverty may walk--many low\\nroofs would point more truly to the sky, than the loftiest steeple that\\nnow rears proudly up from the midst of guilt, and crime, and horrible\\ndisease, to mock them by its contrast.', 'In hollow voices from\\nWorkhouse, Hospital, and jail, this truth is preached from day to day,\\nand has been proclaimed for years.', 'It is no light matter--no outcry\\nfrom the working vulgar--no mere question of the people’s health and\\ncomforts that may be whistled down on Wednesday nights.', 'In love of\\nhome, the love of country has its rise; and who are the truer patriots\\nor the better in time of need--those who venerate the land, owning its\\nwood, and stream, and earth, and all that they produce?', 'or those who\\nlove their country, boasting not a foot of ground in all its wide\\ndomain!', 'Kit knew nothing about such questions, but he knew that his old home\\nwas a very poor place, and that his new one was very unlike it, and yet\\nhe was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and\\naffectionate anxiety, and often indited square-folded letters to his\\nmother, enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small\\nremittance, which Mr Abel’s liberality enabled him to make.', 'Sometimes\\nbeing in the neighbourhood, he had leisure to call upon her, and then\\ngreat was the joy and pride of Kit’s mother, and extremely noisy the\\nsatisfaction of little Jacob and the baby, and cordial the\\ncongratulations of the whole court, who listened with admiring ears to\\nthe accounts of Abel Cottage, and could never be told too much of its\\nwonders and magnificence.', 'Although Kit was in the very highest favour with the old lady and\\ngentleman, and Mr Abel, and Barbara, it is certain that no member of\\nthe family evinced such a remarkable partiality for him as the\\nself-willed pony, who, from being the most obstinate and opinionated\\npony on the face of the earth, was, in his hands, the meekest and most\\ntractable of animals.', 'It is true that in exact proportion as he became\\nmanageable by Kit he became utterly ungovernable by anybody else (as if\\nhe had determined to keep him in the family at all risks and hazards),\\nand that, even under the guidance of his favourite, he would sometimes\\nperform a great variety of strange freaks and capers, to the extreme\\ndiscomposure of the old lady’s nerves; but as Kit always represented\\nthat this was only his fun, or a way he had of showing his attachment\\nto his employers, Mrs Garland gradually suffered herself to be\\npersuaded into the belief, in which she at last became so strongly\\nconfirmed, that if, in one of these ebullitions, he had overturned the\\nchaise, she would have been quite satisfied that he did it with the\\nvery best intentions.', 'Besides becoming in a short time a perfect marvel in all stable\\nmatters, Kit soon made himself a very tolerable gardener, a handy\\nfellow within doors, and an indispensable attendant on Mr Abel, who\\nevery day gave him some new proof of his confidence and approbation.', 'Mr Witherden the notary, too, regarded him with a friendly eye; and\\neven Mr Chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod,\\nor to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called\\n‘taking a sight,’ or to favour him with some other salute combining\\npleasantry with patronage.', 'One morning Kit drove Mr Abel to the Notary’s office, as he sometimes\\ndid, and having set him down at the house, was about to drive off to a\\nlivery stable hard by, when this same Mr Chuckster emerged from the\\noffice door, and cried ‘Woa-a-a-a-a-a!’--dwelling upon the note a long\\ntime, for the purpose of striking terror into the pony’s heart, and\\nasserting the supremacy of man over the inferior animals.', '‘Pull up, Snobby,’ cried Mr Chuckster, addressing himself to Kit.', '‘You’re wanted inside here.’\\n\\n‘Has Mr Abel forgotten anything, I wonder?’ said Kit as he dismounted.', '‘Ask no questions, Snobby,’ returned Mr Chuckster, ‘but go and see.', 'Woa-a-a then, will you?', 'If that pony was mine, I’d break him.’\\n\\n‘You must be very gentle with him, if you please,’ said Kit, ‘or you’ll\\nfind him troublesome.', 'You’d better not keep on pulling his ears,\\nplease.', 'I know he won’t like it.’\\n\\nTo this remonstrance Mr Chuckster deigned no other answer, than\\naddressing Kit with a lofty and distant air as ‘young feller,’ and\\nrequesting him to cut and come again with all speed.', 'The ‘young\\nfeller’ complying, Mr Chuckster put his hands in his pockets, and tried\\nto look as if he were not minding the pony, but happened to be lounging\\nthere by accident.', 'Kit scraped his shoes very carefully (for he had not yet lost his\\nreverence for the bundles of papers and the tin boxes,) and tapped at\\nthe office-door, which was quickly opened by the Notary himself.', '‘Oh!', 'come in, Christopher,’ said Mr Witherden.', '‘Is that the lad?’ asked an elderly gentleman, but of a stout, bluff\\nfigure--who was in the room.', '‘That’s the lad,’ said Mr Witherden.', '‘He fell in with my client, Mr\\nGarland, sir, at this very door.', 'I have reason to think he is a good\\nlad, sir, and that you may believe what he says.', 'Let me introduce Mr\\nAbel Garland, sir--his young master; my articled pupil, sir, and most\\nparticular friend:--my most particular friend, sir,’ repeated the\\nNotary, drawing out his silk handkerchief and flourishing it about his\\nface.', '‘Your servant, sir,’ said the stranger gentleman.', '‘Yours, sir, I’m sure,’ replied Mr Abel mildly.', '‘You were wishing to\\nspeak to Christopher, sir?’\\n\\n‘Yes, I was.', 'Have I your permission?’\\n\\n‘By all means.’\\n\\n‘My business is no secret; or I should rather say it need be no secret\\nhere,’ said the stranger, observing that Mr Abel and the Notary were\\npreparing to retire.', '‘It relates to a dealer in curiosities with whom\\nhe lived, and in whom I am earnestly and warmly interested.', 'I have\\nbeen a stranger to this country, gentlemen, for very many years, and if\\nI am deficient in form and ceremony, I hope you will forgive me.’\\n\\n‘No forgiveness is necessary, sir;--none whatever,’ replied the Notary.', 'And so said Mr Abel.', '‘I have been making inquiries in the neighbourhood in which his old\\nmaster lived,’ said the stranger, ‘and I learn that he was served by\\nthis lad.', 'I have found out his mother’s house, and have been directed\\nby her to this place as the nearest in which I should be likely to find\\nhim.', 'That’s the cause of my presenting myself here this morning.’\\n\\n‘I am very glad of any cause, sir,’ said the Notary, ‘which procures me\\nthe honour of this visit.’\\n\\n‘Sir,’ retorted the stranger, ‘you speak like a mere man of the world,\\nand I think you something better.', 'Therefore, pray do not sink your\\nreal character in paying unmeaning compliments to me.’\\n\\n‘Hem!’ coughed the Notary.', '‘You’re a plain speaker, sir.’\\n\\n‘And a plain dealer,’ returned the stranger.', '‘It may be my long\\nabsence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion; but if plain\\nspeakers are scarce in this part of the world, I fancy plain dealers\\nare still scarcer.', 'If my speaking should offend you, sir, my dealing,\\nI hope, will make amends.’\\n\\nMr Witherden seemed a little disconcerted by the elderly gentleman’s\\nmode of conducting the dialogue; and as for Kit, he looked at him in\\nopen-mouthed astonishment: wondering what kind of language he would\\naddress to him, if he talked in that free and easy way to a Notary.', 'It\\nwas with no harshness, however, though with something of constitutional\\nirritability and haste, that he turned to Kit and said:\\n\\n‘If you think, my lad, that I am pursuing these inquiries with any\\nother view than that of serving and reclaiming those I am in search of,\\nyou do me a very great wrong, and deceive yourself.', 'Don’t be deceived,\\nI beg of you, but rely upon my assurance.', 'The fact is, gentlemen,’ he\\nadded, turning again to the Notary and his pupil, ‘that I am in a very\\npainful and wholly unexpected position.', 'I came to this city with a\\ndarling object at my heart, expecting to find no obstacle or difficulty\\nin the way of its attainment.', 'I find myself suddenly checked and\\nstopped short, in the execution of my design, by a mystery which I\\ncannot penetrate.', 'Every effort I have made to penetrate it, has only\\nserved to render it darker and more obscure; and I am afraid to stir\\nopenly in the matter, lest those whom I anxiously pursue, should fly\\nstill farther from me.', 'I assure you that if you could give me any\\nassistance, you would not be sorry to do so, if you knew how greatly I\\nstand in need of it, and what a load it would relieve me from.’\\n\\nThere was a simplicity in this confidence which occasioned it to find a\\nquick response in the breast of the good-natured Notary, who replied,\\nin the same spirit, that the stranger had not mistaken his desire, and\\nthat if he could be of service to him, he would, most readily.', 'Kit was then put under examination and closely questioned by the\\nunknown gentleman, touching his old master and the child, their lonely\\nway of life, their retired habits, and strict seclusion.', 'The nightly\\nabsence of the old man, the solitary existence of the child at those\\ntimes, his illness and recovery, Quilp’s possession of the house, and\\ntheir sudden disappearance, were all the subjects of much questioning\\nand answer.', 'Finally, Kit informed the gentleman that the premises were\\nnow to let, and that a board upon the door referred all inquirers to Mr\\nSampson Brass, Solicitor, of Bevis Marks, from whom he might perhaps\\nlearn some further particulars.', '‘Not by inquiry,’ said the gentleman shaking his head.', '‘I live there.’\\n\\n‘Live at Brass’s the attorney’s!’ cried Mr Witherden in some surprise:\\nhaving professional knowledge of the gentleman in question.', '‘Aye,’ was the reply.', '‘I entered on his lodgings t’other day, chiefly\\nbecause I had seen this very board.', 'It matters little to me where I\\nlive, and I had a desperate hope that some intelligence might be cast\\nin my way there, which would not reach me elsewhere.', 'Yes, I live at\\nBrass’s--more shame for me, I suppose?’\\n\\n‘That’s a mere matter of opinion,’ said the Notary, shrugging his\\nshoulders.', '‘He is looked upon as rather a doubtful character.’\\n\\n‘Doubtful?’ echoed the other.', '‘I am glad to hear there’s any doubt\\nabout it.', 'I supposed that had been thoroughly settled, long ago.', 'But\\nwill you let me speak a word or two with you in private?’\\n\\nMr Witherden consenting, they walked into that gentleman’s private\\ncloset, and remained there, in close conversation, for some quarter of\\nan hour, when they returned into the outer office.', 'The stranger had\\nleft his hat in Mr Witherden’s room, and seemed to have established\\nhimself in this short interval on quite a friendly footing.', '‘I’ll not detain you any longer now,’ he said, putting a crown into\\nKit’s hand, and looking towards the Notary.', '‘You shall hear from me\\nagain.', 'Not a word of this, you know, except to your master and\\nmistress.’\\n\\n‘Mother, sir, would be glad to know--’ said Kit, faltering.', '‘Glad to know what?’\\n\\n‘Anything--so that it was no harm--about Miss Nell.’\\n\\n‘Would she?', 'Well then, you may tell her if she can keep a secret.', 'But\\nmind, not a word of this to anybody else.', 'Don’t forget that.', 'Be\\nparticular.’\\n\\n‘I’ll take care, sir,’ said Kit.', '‘Thankee, sir, and good morning.’\\n\\nNow, it happened that the gentleman, in his anxiety to impress upon Kit\\nthat he was not to tell anybody what had passed between them, followed\\nhim out to the door to repeat his caution, and it further happened that\\nat that moment the eyes of Mr Richard Swiveller were turned in that\\ndirection, and beheld his mysterious friend and Kit together.', 'It was quite an accident, and the way in which it came about was this.', 'Mr Chuckster, being a gentleman of a cultivated taste and refined\\nspirit, was one of that Lodge of Glorious Apollos whereof Mr Swiveller\\nwas Perpetual Grand.', 'Mr Swiveller, passing through the street in the\\nexecution of some Brazen errand, and beholding one of his Glorious\\nBrotherhood intently gazing on a pony, crossed over to give him that\\nfraternal greeting with which Perpetual Grands are, by the very\\nconstitution of their office, bound to cheer and encourage their\\ndisciples.', 'He had scarcely bestowed upon him his blessing, and\\nfollowed it with a general remark touching the present state and\\nprospects of the weather, when, lifting up his eyes, he beheld the\\nsingle gentleman of Bevis Marks in earnest conversation with\\nChristopher Nubbles.', '‘Hallo!’ said Dick, ‘who is that?’\\n\\n‘He called to see my Governor this morning,’ replied Mr Chuckster;\\n‘beyond that, I don’t know him from Adam.’\\n\\n‘At least you know his name?’ said Dick.', 'To which Mr Chuckster replied, with an elevation of speech becoming a\\nGlorious Apollo, that he was ‘everlastingly blessed’ if he did.', '‘All I know, my dear feller,’ said Mr Chuckster, running his fingers\\nthrough his hair, ‘is, that he is the cause of my having stood here\\ntwenty minutes, for which I hate him with a mortal and undying hatred,\\nand would pursue him to the confines of eternity if I could afford the\\ntime.’\\n\\nWhile they were thus discoursing, the subject of their conversation\\n(who had not appeared to recognise Mr Richard Swiveller) re-entered the\\nhouse, and Kit came down the steps and joined them; to whom Mr\\nSwiveller again propounded his inquiry with no better success.', '‘He is a very nice gentleman, Sir,’ said Kit, ‘and that’s all I know\\nabout him.’\\n\\nMr Chuckster waxed wroth at this answer, and without applying the\\nremark to any particular case, mentioned, as a general truth, that it\\nwas expedient to break the heads of Snobs, and to tweak their noses.', 'Without expressing his concurrence in this sentiment, Mr Swiveller\\nafter a few moments of abstraction inquired which way Kit was driving,\\nand, being informed, declared it was his way, and that he would\\ntrespass on him for a lift.', 'Kit would gladly have declined the\\nproffered honour, but as Mr Swiveller was already established in the\\nseat beside him, he had no means of doing so, otherwise than by a\\nforcible ejectment, and therefore, drove briskly off--so briskly\\nindeed, as to cut short the leave-taking between Mr Chuckster and his\\nGrand Master, and to occasion the former gentleman some inconvenience\\nfrom having his corns squeezed by the impatient pony.', 'As Whisker was tired of standing, and Mr Swiveller was kind enough to\\nstimulate him by shrill whistles, and various sporting cries, they\\nrattled off at too sharp a pace to admit of much conversation:\\nespecially as the pony, incensed by Mr Swiveller’s admonitions, took a\\nparticular fancy for the lamp-posts and cart-wheels, and evinced a\\nstrong desire to run on the pavement and rasp himself against the brick\\nwalls.', 'It was not, therefore, until they had arrived at the stable,\\nand the chaise had been extricated from a very small doorway, into\\nwhich the pony dragged it under the impression that he could take it\\nalong with him into his usual stall, that Mr Swiveller found time to\\ntalk.', '‘It’s hard work,’ said Richard.', '‘What do you say to some beer?’\\n\\nKit at first declined, but presently consented, and they adjourned to\\nthe neighbouring bar together.', '‘We’ll drink our friend what’s-his-name,’ said Dick, holding up the\\nbright frothy pot; ‘--that was talking to you this morning, you know--I\\nknow him--a good fellow, but eccentric--very--here’s what’s-his-name!’\\n\\nKit pledged him.', '‘He lives in my house,’ said Dick; ‘at least in the house occupied by\\nthe firm in which I’m a sort of a--of a managing partner--a difficult\\nfellow to get anything out of, but we like him--we like him.’\\n\\n‘I must be going, sir, if you please,’ said Kit, moving away.', '‘Don’t be in a hurry, Christopher,’ replied his patron, ‘we’ll drink\\nyour mother.’\\n\\n‘Thank you, sir.’\\n\\n‘An excellent woman that mother of yours, Christopher,’ said Mr\\nSwiveller.', '‘Who ran to catch me when I fell, and kissed the place to\\nmake it well?', 'My mother.', 'A charming woman.', 'He’s a liberal sort of\\nfellow.', 'We must get him to do something for your mother.', 'Does he know\\nher, Christopher?’\\n\\nKit shook his head, and glancing slyly at his questioner, thanked him,\\nand made off before he could say another word.', '‘Humph!’ said Mr Swiveller pondering, ‘this is queer.', 'Nothing but\\nmysteries in connection with Brass’s house.', 'I’ll keep my own counsel,\\nhowever.', 'Everybody and anybody has been in my confidence as yet, but\\nnow I think I’ll set up in business for myself.', 'Queer--very queer!’\\n\\nAfter pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some\\ntime, Mr Swiveller drank some more of the beer, and summoning a small\\nboy who had been watching his proceedings, poured forth the few\\nremaining drops as a libation on the gravel, and bade him carry the\\nempty vessel to the bar with his compliments, and above all things to\\nlead a sober and temperate life, and abstain from all intoxicating and\\nexciting liquors.', 'Having given him this piece of moral advice for his\\ntrouble (which, as he wisely observed, was far better than half-pence)\\nthe Perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious Apollos thrust his hands\\ninto his pockets and sauntered away: still pondering as he went.', 'CHAPTER 39\\n\\nAll that day, though he waited for Mr Abel until evening, Kit kept\\nclear of his mother’s house, determined not to anticipate the pleasures\\nof the morrow, but to let them come in their full rush of delight; for\\nto-morrow was the great and long looked-for epoch in his\\nlife--to-morrow was the end of his first quarter--the day of receiving,\\nfor the first time, one fourth part of his annual income of Six Pounds\\nin one vast sum of Thirty Shillings--to-morrow was to be a half-holiday\\ndevoted to a whirl of entertainments, and little Jacob was to know what\\noysters meant, and to see a play.', 'All manner of incidents combined in favour of the occasion: not only\\nhad Mr and Mrs Garland forewarned him that they intended to make no\\ndeduction for his outfit from the great amount, but to pay it him\\nunbroken in all its gigantic grandeur; not only had the unknown\\ngentleman increased the stock by the sum of five shillings, which was a\\nperfect god-send and in itself a fortune; not only had these things\\ncome to pass which nobody could have calculated upon, or in their\\nwildest dreams have hoped; but it was Barbara’s quarter too--Barbara’s\\nquarter, that very day--and Barbara had a half-holiday as well as Kit,\\nand Barbara’s mother was going to make one of the party, and to take\\ntea with Kit’s mother, and cultivate her acquaintance.', 'To be sure Kit looked out of his window very early that morning to see\\nwhich way the clouds were flying, and to be sure Barbara would have\\nbeen at hers too, if she had not sat up so late over-night, starching\\nand ironing small pieces of muslin, and crimping them into frills, and\\nsewing them on to other pieces to form magnificent wholes for next\\nday’s wear.', 'But they were both up very early for all that, and had\\nsmall appetites for breakfast and less for dinner, and were in a state\\nof great excitement when Barbara’s mother came in, with astonishing\\naccounts of the fineness of the weather out of doors (but with a very\\nlarge umbrella notwithstanding, for people like Barbara’s mother seldom\\nmake holiday without one), and when the bell rang for them to go up\\nstairs and receive their quarter’s money in gold and silver.', 'Well, wasn’t Mr Garland kind when he said ‘Christopher, here’s your\\nmoney, and you have earned it well;’ and wasn’t Mrs Garland kind when\\nshe said ‘Barbara, here’s yours, and I’m much pleased with you;’ and\\ndidn’t Kit sign his name bold to his receipt, and didn’t Barbara sign\\nher name all a trembling to hers; and wasn’t it beautiful to see how\\nMrs Garland poured out Barbara’s mother a glass of wine; and didn’t\\nBarbara’s mother speak up when she said ‘Here’s blessing you, ma’am, as\\na good lady, and you, sir, as a good gentleman, and Barbara, my love to\\nyou, and here’s towards you, Mr Christopher;’ and wasn’t she as long\\ndrinking it as if it had been a tumblerful; and didn’t she look\\ngenteel, standing there with her gloves on; and wasn’t there plenty of\\nlaughing and talking among them as they reviewed all these things upon\\nthe top of the coach, and didn’t they pity the people who hadn’t got a\\nholiday!', 'But Kit’s mother, again--wouldn’t anybody have supposed she had come of\\na good stock and been a lady all her life!', 'There she was, quite ready\\nto receive them, with a display of tea-things that might have warmed\\nthe heart of a china-shop; and little Jacob and the baby in such a\\nstate of perfection that their clothes looked as good as new, though\\nHeaven knows they were old enough!', 'Didn’t she say before they had sat\\ndown five minutes that Barbara’s mother was exactly the sort of lady\\nshe expected, and didn’t Barbara’s mother say that Kit’s mother was the\\nvery picture of what she had expected, and didn’t Kit’s mother\\ncompliment Barbara’s mother on Barbara, and didn’t Barbara’s mother\\ncompliment Kit’s mother on Kit, and wasn’t Barbara herself quite\\nfascinated with little Jacob, and did ever a child show off when he was\\nwanted, as that child did, or make such friends as he made!', '‘And we are both widows too!’ said Barbara’s mother.', '‘We must have\\nbeen made to know each other.’\\n\\n‘I haven’t a doubt about it,’ returned Mrs Nubbles.', '‘And what a pity\\nit is we didn’t know each other sooner.’\\n\\n‘But then, you know, it’s such a pleasure,’ said Barbara’s mother, ‘to\\nhave it brought about by one’s son and daughter, that it’s fully made\\nup for.', 'Now, an’t it?’\\n\\nTo this, Kit’s mother yielded her full assent, and tracing things back\\nfrom effects to causes, they naturally reverted to their deceased\\nhusbands, respecting whose lives, deaths, and burials, they compared\\nnotes, and discovered sundry circumstances that tallied with wonderful\\nexactness; such as Barbara’s father having been exactly four years and\\nten months older than Kit’s father, and one of them having died on a\\nWednesday and the other on a Thursday, and both of them having been of\\na very fine make and remarkably good-looking, with other extraordinary\\ncoincidences.', 'These recollections being of a kind calculated to cast a\\nshadow on the brightness of the holiday, Kit diverted the conversation\\nto general topics, and they were soon in great force again, and as\\nmerry as before.', 'Among other things, Kit told them about his old\\nplace, and the extraordinary beauty of Nell (of whom he had talked to\\nBarbara a thousand times already); but the last-named circumstance\\nfailed to interest his hearers to anything like the extent he had\\nsupposed, and even his mother said (looking accidentally at Barbara at\\nthe same time) that there was no doubt Miss Nell was very pretty, but\\nshe was but a child after all, and there were many young women quite as\\npretty as she; and Barbara mildly observed that she should think so,\\nand that she never could help believing Mr Christopher must be under a\\nmistake--which Kit wondered at very much, not being able to conceive\\nwhat reason she had for doubting him.', 'Barbara’s mother too, observed\\nthat it was very common for young folks to change at about fourteen or\\nfifteen, and whereas they had been very pretty before, to grow up quite\\nplain; which truth she illustrated by many forcible examples,\\nespecially one of a young man, who, being a builder with great\\nprospects, had been particular in his attentions to Barbara, but whom\\nBarbara would have nothing to say to; which (though everything happened\\nfor the best) she almost thought was a pity.', 'Kit said he thought so\\ntoo, and so he did honestly, and he wondered what made Barbara so\\nsilent all at once, and why his mother looked at him as if he shouldn’t\\nhave said it.', 'However, it was high time now to be thinking of the play; for which\\ngreat preparation was required, in the way of shawls and bonnets, not\\nto mention one handkerchief full of oranges and another of apples,\\nwhich took some time tying up, in consequence of the fruit having a\\ntendency to roll out at the corners.', 'At length, everything was ready,\\nand they went off very fast; Kit’s mother carrying the baby, who was\\ndreadfully wide awake, and Kit holding little Jacob in one hand, and\\nescorting Barbara with the other--a state of things which occasioned\\nthe two mothers, who walked behind, to declare that they looked quite\\nfamily folks, and caused Barbara to blush and say, ‘Now don’t, mother!’\\nBut Kit said she had no call to mind what they said; and indeed she\\nneed not have had, if she had known how very far from Kit’s thoughts\\nany love-making was.', 'Poor Barbara!', 'At last they got to the theatre, which was Astley’s: and in some two\\nminutes after they had reached the yet unopened door, little Jacob was\\nsqueezed flat, and the baby had received divers concussions, and\\nBarbara’s mother’s umbrella had been carried several yards off and\\npassed back to her over the shoulders of the people, and Kit had hit a\\nman on the head with the handkerchief of apples for ‘scrowdging’ his\\nparent with unnecessary violence, and there was a great uproar.', 'But,\\nwhen they were once past the pay-place and tearing away for very life\\nwith their checks in their hands, and, above all, when they were fairly\\nin the theatre, and seated in such places that they couldn’t have had\\nbetter if they had picked them out, and taken them beforehand, all this\\nwas looked upon as quite a capital joke, and an essential part of the\\nentertainment.', 'Dear, dear, what a place it looked, that Astley’s; with all the paint,\\ngilding, and looking-glass; the vague smell of horses suggestive of\\ncoming wonders; the curtain that hid such gorgeous mysteries; the clean\\nwhite sawdust down in the circus; the company coming in and taking\\ntheir places; the fiddlers looking carelessly up at them while they\\ntuned their instruments, as if they didn’t want the play to begin, and\\nknew it all beforehand!', 'What a glow was that, which burst upon them\\nall, when that long, clear, brilliant row of lights came slowly up; and\\nwhat the feverish excitement when the little bell rang and the music\\nbegan in good earnest, with strong parts for the drums, and sweet\\neffects for the triangles!', 'Well might Barbara’s mother say to Kit’s\\nmother that the gallery was the place to see from, and wonder it wasn’t\\nmuch dearer than the boxes; well might Barbara feel doubtful whether to\\nlaugh or cry, in her flutter of delight.', 'Then the play itself!', 'the horses which little Jacob believed from the\\nfirst to be alive, and the ladies and gentlemen of whose reality he\\ncould be by no means persuaded, having never seen or heard anything at\\nall like them--the firing, which made Barbara wink--the forlorn lady,\\nwho made her cry--the tyrant, who made her tremble--the man who sang\\nthe song with the lady’s-maid and danced the chorus, who made her\\nlaugh--the pony who reared up on his hind legs when he saw the\\nmurderer, and wouldn’t hear of walking on all fours again until he was\\ntaken into custody--the clown who ventured on such familiarities with\\nthe military man in boots--the lady who jumped over the nine-and-twenty\\nribbons and came down safe upon the horse’s back--everything was\\ndelightful, splendid, and surprising!', 'Little Jacob applauded till his\\nhands were sore; Kit cried ‘an-kor’ at the end of everything, the\\nthree-act piece included; and Barbara’s mother beat her umbrella on the\\nfloor, in her ecstasies, until it was nearly worn down to the gingham.', 'In the midst of all these fascinations, Barbara’s thoughts seemed to\\nhave been still running on what Kit had said at tea-time; for, when\\nthey were coming out of the play, she asked him, with an hysterical\\nsimper, if Miss Nell was as handsome as the lady who jumped over the\\nribbons.', '‘As handsome as her?’ said Kit.', '‘Double as handsome.’\\n\\n‘Oh Christopher!', 'I’m sure she was the beautifullest creature ever was,’\\nsaid Barbara.', '‘Nonsense!’ returned Kit.', '‘She was well enough, I don’t deny that; but\\nthink how she was dressed and painted, and what a difference that made.', 'Why YOU are a good deal better looking than her, Barbara.’\\n\\n‘Oh Christopher!’ said Barbara, looking down.', '‘You are, any day,’ said Kit, ‘--and so’s your mother.’\\n\\nPoor Barbara!', 'What was all this though--even all this--to the extraordinary\\ndissipation that ensued, when Kit, walking into an oyster-shop as bold\\nas if he lived there, and not so much as looking at the counter or the\\nman behind it, led his party into a box--a private box, fitted up with\\nred curtains, white table-cloth, and cruet-stand complete--and ordered\\na fierce gentleman with whiskers, who acted as waiter and called him,\\nhim Christopher Nubbles, ‘sir,’ to bring three dozen of his\\nlargest-sized oysters, and to look sharp about it!', 'Yes, Kit told this\\ngentleman to look sharp, and he not only said he would look sharp, but\\nhe actually did, and presently came running back with the newest\\nloaves, and the freshest butter, and the largest oysters, ever seen.', 'Then said Kit to this gentleman, ‘a pot of beer’--just so--and the\\ngentleman, instead of replying, ‘Sir, did you address that language to\\nme?’ only said, ‘Pot o’ beer, sir?', 'Yes, sir,’ and went off and fetched\\nit, and put it on the table in a small decanter-stand, like those which\\nblind-men’s dogs carry about the streets in their mouths, to catch the\\nhalf-pence in; and both Kit’s mother and Barbara’s mother declared as\\nhe turned away that he was one of the slimmest and gracefullest young\\nmen she had ever looked upon.', 'Then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest; and there was\\nBarbara, that foolish Barbara, declaring that she could not eat more\\nthan two, and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she\\nwould eat four: though her mother and Kit’s mother made up for it\\npretty well, and ate and laughed and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly\\nthat it did Kit good to see them, and made him laugh and eat likewise\\nfrom strong sympathy.', 'But the greatest miracle of the night was little\\nJacob, who ate oysters as if he had been born and bred to the\\nbusiness--sprinkled the pepper and the vinegar with a discretion beyond\\nhis years--and afterwards built a grotto on the table with the shells.', 'There was the baby too, who had never closed an eye all night, but had\\nsat as good as gold, trying to force a large orange into his mouth, and\\ngazing intently at the lights in the chandelier--there he was, sitting\\nup in his mother’s lap, staring at the gas without winking, and making\\nindentations in his soft visage with an oyster-shell, to that degree\\nthat a heart of iron must have loved him!', 'In short, there never was a\\nmore successful supper; and when Kit ordered in a glass of something\\nhot to finish with, and proposed Mr and Mrs Garland before sending it\\nround, there were not six happier people in all the world.', 'But all happiness has an end--hence the chief pleasure of its next\\nbeginning--and as it was now growing late, they agreed it was time to\\nturn their faces homewards.', 'So, after going a little out of their way\\nto see Barbara and Barbara’s mother safe to a friend’s house where they\\nwere to pass the night, Kit and his mother left them at the door, with\\nan early appointment for returning to Finchley next morning, and a\\ngreat many plans for next quarter’s enjoyment.', 'Then, Kit took little\\nJacob on his back, and giving his arm to his mother, and a kiss to the\\nbaby, they all trudged merrily home together.', 'CHAPTER 40\\n\\nFull of that vague kind of penitence which holidays awaken next\\nmorning, Kit turned out at sunrise, and, with his faith in last night’s\\nenjoyments a little shaken by cool daylight and the return to every-day\\nduties and occupations, went to meet Barbara and her mother at the\\nappointed place.', 'And being careful not to awaken any of the little\\nhousehold, who were yet resting from their unusual fatigues, Kit left\\nhis money on the chimney-piece, with an inscription in chalk calling\\nhis mother’s attention to the circumstance, and informing her that it\\ncame from her dutiful son; and went his way, with a heart something\\nheavier than his pockets, but free from any very great oppression\\nnotwithstanding.', 'Oh these holidays!', 'why will they leave us some regret?', 'why cannot we\\npush them back, only a week or two in our memories, so as to put them\\nat once at that convenient distance whence they may be regarded either\\nwith a calm indifference or a pleasant effort of recollection!', 'why will\\nthey hang about us, like the flavour of yesterday’s wine, suggestive of\\nheadaches and lassitude, and those good intentions for the future,\\nwhich, under the earth, form the everlasting pavement of a large\\nestate, and, upon it, usually endure until dinner-time or thereabouts!', 'Who will wonder that Barbara had a headache, or that Barbara’s mother\\nwas disposed to be cross, or that she slightly underrated Astley’s, and\\nthought the clown was older than they had taken him to be last night?', 'Kit was not surprised to hear her say so--not he.', 'He had already had a\\nmisgiving that the inconstant actors in that dazzling vision had been\\ndoing the same thing the night before last, and would do it again that\\nnight, and the next, and for weeks and months to come, though he would\\nnot be there.', 'Such is the difference between yesterday and today.', 'We\\nare all going to the play, or coming home from it.', 'However, the Sun himself is weak when he first rises, and gathers\\nstrength and courage as the day gets on.', 'By degrees, they began to\\nrecall circumstances more and more pleasant in their nature, until,\\nwhat between talking, walking, and laughing, they reached Finchley in\\nsuch good heart, that Barbara’s mother declared she never felt less\\ntired or in better spirits.', 'And so said Kit.', 'Barbara had been silent\\nall the way, but she said so too.', 'Poor little Barbara!', 'She was very\\nquiet.', 'They were at home in such good time that Kit had rubbed down the pony\\nand made him as spruce as a race-horse, before Mr Garland came down to\\nbreakfast; which punctual and industrious conduct the old lady, and the\\nold gentleman, and Mr Abel, highly extolled.', 'At his usual hour (or\\nrather at his usual minute and second, for he was the soul of\\npunctuality) Mr Abel walked out, to be overtaken by the London coach,\\nand Kit and the old gentleman went to work in the garden.', 'This was not the least pleasant of Kit’s employments.', 'On a fine day\\nthey were quite a family party; the old lady sitting hard by with her\\nwork-basket on a little table; the old gentleman digging, or pruning,\\nor clipping about with a large pair of shears, or helping Kit in some\\nway or other with great assiduity; and Whisker looking on from his\\npaddock in placid contemplation of them all.', 'To-day they were to trim\\nthe grape-vine, so Kit mounted half-way up a short ladder, and began to\\nsnip and hammer away, while the old gentleman, with a great interest in\\nhis proceedings, handed up the nails and shreds of cloth as he wanted\\nthem.', 'The old lady and Whisker looked on as usual.', '‘Well, Christopher,’ said Mr Garland, ‘and so you have made a new\\nfriend, eh?’\\n\\n‘I beg your pardon, Sir?’ returned Kit, looking down from the ladder.', '‘You have made a new friend, I hear from Mr Abel,’ said the old\\ngentleman, ‘at the office!’\\n\\n‘Oh!', 'Yes Sir, yes.', 'He behaved very handsome, Sir.’\\n\\n‘I’m glad to hear it,’ returned the old gentlemen with a smile.', '‘He is\\ndisposed to behave more handsomely still, though, Christopher.’\\n\\n‘Indeed, Sir!', 'It’s very kind in him, but I don’t want him to, I’m\\nsure,’ said Kit, hammering stoutly at an obdurate nail.', '‘He is rather anxious,’ pursued the old gentleman, ‘to have you in his\\nown service--take care what you’re doing, or you will fall down and\\nhurt yourself.’\\n\\n‘To have me in his service, Sir?’ cried Kit, who had stopped short in\\nhis work and faced about on the ladder like some dexterous tumbler.', '‘Why, Sir, I don’t think he can be in earnest when he says that.’\\n\\n‘Oh!', 'But he is indeed,’ said Mr Garland.', '‘And he has told Mr Abel so.’\\n\\n‘I never heard of such a thing!’ muttered Kit, looking ruefully at his\\nmaster and mistress.', '‘I wonder at him; that I do.’\\n\\n‘You see, Christopher,’ said Mr Garland, ‘this is a point of much\\nimportance to you, and you should understand and consider it in that\\nlight.', 'This gentleman is able to give you more money than I--not, I\\nhope, to carry through the various relations of master and servant,\\nmore kindness and confidence, but certainly, Christopher, to give you\\nmore money.’\\n\\n‘Well,’ said Kit, ‘after that, Sir--’\\n\\n‘Wait a moment,’ interposed Mr Garland.', '‘That is not all.', 'You were a\\nvery faithful servant to your old employers, as I understand, and\\nshould this gentleman recover them, as it is his purpose to attempt\\ndoing by every means in his power, I have no doubt that you, being in\\nhis service, would meet with your reward.', 'Besides,’ added the old\\ngentleman with stronger emphasis, ‘besides having the pleasure of being\\nagain brought into communication with those to whom you seem to be very\\nstrongly and disinterestedly attached.', 'You must think of all this,\\nChristopher, and not be rash or hasty in your choice.’\\n\\nKit did suffer one twinge, one momentary pang, in keeping the\\nresolution he had already formed, when this last argument passed\\nswiftly into his thoughts, and conjured up the realization of all his\\nhopes and fancies.', 'But it was gone in a minute, and he sturdily\\nrejoined that the gentleman must look out for somebody else, as he did\\nthink he might have done at first.', '‘He has no right to think that I’d be led away to go to him, sir,’ said\\nKit, turning round again after half a minute’s hammering.', '‘Does he\\nthink I’m a fool?’\\n\\n‘He may, perhaps, Christopher, if you refuse his offer,’ said Mr\\nGarland gravely.', '‘Then let him, sir,’ retorted Kit; ‘what do I care, sir, what he\\nthinks?', 'why should I care for his thinking, sir, when I know that I\\nshould be a fool, and worse than a fool, sir, to leave the kindest\\nmaster and mistress that ever was or can be, who took me out of the\\nstreets a very poor and hungry lad indeed--poorer and hungrier perhaps\\nthan even you think for, sir--to go to him or anybody?', 'If Miss Nell\\nwas to come back, ma’am,’ added Kit, turning suddenly to his mistress,\\n‘why that would be another thing, and perhaps if she wanted me, I might\\nask you now and then to let me work for her when all was done at home.', 'But when she comes back, I see now that she’ll be rich as old master\\nalways said she would, and being a rich young lady, what could she want\\nof me?', 'No, no,’ added Kit, shaking his head sorrowfully, ‘she’ll never\\nwant me any more, and bless her, I hope she never may, though I should\\nlike to see her too!’\\n\\nHere Kit drove a nail into the wall, very hard--much harder than was\\nnecessary--and having done so, faced about again.', '‘There’s the pony, sir,’ said Kit--‘Whisker, ma’am (and he knows so\\nwell I’m talking about him that he begins to neigh directly,\\nSir)--would he let anybody come near him but me, ma’am?', 'Here’s the\\ngarden, sir, and Mr Abel, ma’am.', 'Would Mr Abel part with me, Sir, or\\nis there anybody that could be fonder of the garden, ma’am?', 'It would\\nbreak mother’s heart, Sir, and even little Jacob would have sense\\nenough to cry his eyes out, ma’am, if he thought that Mr Abel could\\nwish to part with me so soon, after having told me, only the other day,\\nthat he hoped we might be together for years to come--’\\n\\nThere is no telling how long Kit might have stood upon the ladder,\\naddressing his master and mistress by turns, and generally turning\\ntowards the wrong person, if Barbara had not at that moment come\\nrunning up to say that a messenger from the office had brought a note,\\nwhich, with an expression of some surprise at Kit’s oratorical\\nappearance, she put into her master’s hand.', '‘Oh!’ said the old gentleman after reading it, ‘ask the messenger to\\nwalk this way.’  Barbara tripping off to do as she was bid, he turned\\nto Kit and said that they would not pursue the subject any further, and\\nthat Kit could not be more unwilling to part with them, than they would\\nbe to part with Kit; a sentiment which the old lady very generously\\nechoed.', '‘At the same time, Christopher,’ added Mr Garland, glancing at the note\\nin his hand, ‘if the gentleman should want to borrow you now and then\\nfor an hour or so, or even a day or so, at a time, we must consent to\\nlend you, and you must consent to be lent.--Oh!', 'here is the young\\ngentleman.', 'How do you do, Sir?’\\n\\nThis salutation was addressed to Mr Chuckster, who, with his hat\\nextremely on one side, and his hair a long way beyond it, came\\nswaggering up the walk.', '‘Hope I see you well sir,’ returned that gentleman.', '‘Hope I see YOU\\nwell, ma’am.', 'Charming box this, sir.', 'Delicious country to be sure.’\\n\\n‘You want to take Kit back with you, I find?’ observed Mr Garland.', '‘I have got a chariot-cab waiting on purpose,’ replied the clerk.', '‘A\\nvery spanking grey in that cab, sir, if you’re a judge of horse-flesh.’\\n\\nDeclining to inspect the spanking grey, on the plea that he was but\\npoorly acquainted with such matters, and would but imperfectly\\nappreciate his beauties, Mr Garland invited Mr Chuckster to partake of\\na slight repast in the way of lunch.', 'That gentleman readily\\nconsenting, certain cold viands, flanked with ale and wine, were\\nspeedily prepared for his refreshment.', 'At this repast, Mr Chuckster exerted his utmost abilities to enchant\\nhis entertainers, and impress them with a conviction of the mental\\nsuperiority of those who dwelt in town; with which view he led the\\ndiscourse to the small scandal of the day, in which he was justly\\nconsidered by his friends to shine prodigiously.', 'Thus, he was in a\\ncondition to relate the exact circumstances of the difference between\\nthe Marquis of Mizzler and Lord Bobby, which it appeared originated in\\na disputed bottle of champagne, and not in a pigeon-pie, as erroneously\\nreported in the newspapers; neither had Lord Bobby said to the Marquis\\nof Mizzler, ‘Mizzler, one of us two tells a lie, and I’m not the man,’\\nas incorrectly stated by the same authorities; but ‘Mizzler, you know\\nwhere I’m to be found, and damme, sir, find me if you want me’--which,\\nof course, entirely changed the aspect of this interesting question,\\nand placed it in a very different light.', 'He also acquainted them with\\nthe precise amount of the income guaranteed by the Duke of Thigsberry\\nto Violetta Stetta of the Italian Opera, which it appeared was payable\\nquarterly, and not half-yearly, as the public had been given to\\nunderstand, and which was EXclusive, and not INclusive (as had been\\nmonstrously stated,) of jewellery, perfumery, hair-powder for five\\nfootmen, and two daily changes of kid-gloves for a page.', 'Having\\nentreated the old lady and gentleman to set their minds at rest on\\nthese absorbing points, for they might rely on his statement being the\\ncorrect one, Mr Chuckster entertained them with theatrical chit-chat\\nand the court circular; and so wound up a brilliant and fascinating\\nconversation which he had maintained alone, and without any assistance\\nwhatever, for upwards of three-quarters of an hour.', '‘And now that the nag has got his wind again,’ said Mr Chuckster rising\\nin a graceful manner, ‘I’m afraid I must cut my stick.’\\n\\nNeither Mr nor Mrs Garland offered any opposition to his tearing\\nhimself away (feeling, no doubt, that such a man could ill be spared\\nfrom his proper sphere of action), and therefore Mr Chuckster and Kit\\nwere shortly afterwards upon their way to town; Kit being perched upon\\nthe box of the cabriolet beside the driver, and Mr Chuckster seated in\\nsolitary state inside, with one of his boots sticking out at each of\\nthe front windows.', 'When they reached the Notary’s house, Kit followed into the office, and\\nwas desired by Mr Abel to sit down and wait, for the gentleman who\\nwanted him had gone out, and perhaps might not return for some time.', 'This anticipation was strictly verified, for Kit had had his dinner,\\nand his tea, and had read all the lighter matter in the Law-List, and\\nthe Post-Office Directory, and had fallen asleep a great many times,\\nbefore the gentleman whom he had seen before, came in; which he did at\\nlast in a very great hurry.', 'He was closeted with Mr Witherden for some little time, and Mr Abel had\\nbeen called in to assist at the conference, before Kit, wondering very\\nmuch what he was wanted for, was summoned to attend them.', '‘Christopher,’ said the gentleman, turning to him directly he entered\\nthe room, ‘I have found your old master and young mistress.’\\n\\n‘No, Sir!', 'Have you, though?’ returned Kit, his eyes sparkling with\\ndelight.', '‘Where are they, Sir?', 'How are they, Sir?', 'Are they--are they\\nnear here?’\\n\\n‘A long way from here,’ returned the gentleman, shaking his head.', '‘But\\nI am going away to-night to bring them back, and I want you to go with\\nme.’\\n\\n‘Me, Sir?’ cried Kit, full of joy and surprise.', '‘The place,’ said the strange gentleman, turning thoughtfully to the\\nNotary, ‘indicated by this man of the dogs, is--how far from\\nhere--sixty miles?’\\n\\n‘From sixty to seventy.’\\n\\n‘Humph!', 'If we travel post all night, we shall reach there in good time\\nto-morrow morning.', 'Now, the only question is, as they will not know\\nme, and the child, God bless her, would think that any stranger\\npursuing them had a design upon her grandfather’s liberty--can I do\\nbetter than take this lad, whom they both know and will readily\\nremember, as an assurance to them of my friendly intentions?’\\n\\n‘Certainly not,’ replied the Notary.', '‘Take Christopher by all means.’\\n\\n‘I beg your pardon, Sir,’ said Kit, who had listened to this discourse\\nwith a lengthening countenance, ‘but if that’s the reason, I’m afraid I\\nshould do more harm than good--Miss Nell, Sir, she knows me, and would\\ntrust in me, I am sure; but old master--I don’t know why, gentlemen;\\nnobody does--would not bear me in his sight after he had been ill, and\\nMiss Nell herself told me that I must not go near him or let him see me\\nany more.', 'I should spoil all that you were doing if I went, I’m\\nafraid.', 'I’d give the world to go, but you had better not take me, Sir.’\\n\\n‘Another difficulty!’ cried the impetuous gentleman.', '‘Was ever man so\\nbeset as I?', 'Is there nobody else that knew them, nobody else in whom\\nthey had any confidence?', 'Solitary as their lives were, is there no one\\nperson who would serve my purpose?’\\n\\n‘IS there, Christopher?’ said the Notary.', '‘Not one, Sir,’ replied Kit.--‘Yes, though--there’s my mother.’\\n\\n‘Did they know her?’ said the single gentleman.', '‘Know her, Sir!', 'why, she was always coming backwards and forwards.', 'They were as kind to her as they were to me.', 'Bless you, Sir, she\\nexpected they’d come back to her house.’\\n\\n‘Then where the devil is the woman?’ said the impatient gentleman,\\ncatching up his hat.', '‘Why isn’t she here?', 'Why is that woman always\\nout of the way when she is most wanted?’\\n\\nIn a word, the single gentleman was bursting out of the office, bent\\nupon laying violent hands on Kit’s mother, forcing her into a\\npost-chaise, and carrying her off, when this novel kind of abduction\\nwas with some difficulty prevented by the joint efforts of Mr Abel and\\nthe Notary, who restrained him by dint of their remonstrances, and\\npersuaded him to sound Kit upon the probability of her being able and\\nwilling to undertake such a journey on so short a notice.', 'This occasioned some doubts on the part of Kit, and some violent\\ndemonstrations on that of the single gentleman, and a great many\\nsoothing speeches on that of the Notary and Mr Abel.', 'The upshot of the\\nbusiness was, that Kit, after weighing the matter in his mind and\\nconsidering it carefully, promised, on behalf of his mother, that she\\nshould be ready within two hours from that time to undertake the\\nexpedition, and engaged to produce her in that place, in all respects\\nequipped and prepared for the journey, before the specified period had\\nexpired.', 'Having given this pledge, which was rather a bold one, and not\\nparticularly easy of redemption, Kit lost no time in sallying forth,\\nand taking measures for its immediate fulfilment.', 'CHAPTER 41\\n\\nKit made his way through the crowded streets, dividing the stream of\\npeople, dashing across the busy road-ways, diving into lanes and\\nalleys, and stopping or turning aside for nothing, until he came in\\nfront of the Old Curiosity Shop, when he came to a stand; partly from\\nhabit and partly from being out of breath.', 'It was a gloomy autumn evening, and he thought the old place had never\\nlooked so dismal as in its dreary twilight.', 'The windows broken, the\\nrusty sashes rattling in their frames, the deserted house a dull\\nbarrier dividing the glaring lights and bustle of the street into two\\nlong lines, and standing in the midst, cold, dark, and empty--presented\\na cheerless spectacle which mingled harshly with the bright prospects\\nthe boy had been building up for its late inmates, and came like a\\ndisappointment or misfortune.', 'Kit would have had a good fire roaring\\nup the empty chimneys, lights sparkling and shining through the\\nwindows, people moving briskly to and fro, voices in cheerful\\nconversation, something in unison with the new hopes that were astir.', 'He had not expected that the house would wear any different aspect--had\\nknown indeed that it could not--but coming upon it in the midst of\\neager thoughts and expectations, it checked the current in its flow,\\nand darkened it with a mournful shadow.', 'Kit, however, fortunately for himself, was not learned enough or\\ncontemplative enough to be troubled with presages of evil afar off,\\nand, having no mental spectacles to assist his vision in this respect,\\nsaw nothing but the dull house, which jarred uncomfortably upon his\\nprevious thoughts.', 'So, almost wishing that he had not passed it,\\nthough hardly knowing why, he hurried on again, making up by his\\nincreased speed for the few moments he had lost.', '‘Now, if she should be out,’ thought Kit, as he approached the poor\\ndwelling of his mother, ‘and I not able to find her, this impatient\\ngentleman would be in a pretty taking.', 'And sure enough there’s no\\nlight, and the door’s fast.', 'Now, God forgive me for saying so, but if\\nthis is Little Bethel’s doing, I wish Little Bethel was--was farther\\noff,’ said Kit checking himself, and knocking at the door.', 'A second knock brought no reply from within the house; but caused a\\nwoman over the way to look out and inquire who that was, awanting Mrs\\nNubbles.', '‘Me,’ said Kit.', '‘She’s at--at Little Bethel, I suppose?’--getting out\\nthe name of the obnoxious conventicle with some reluctance, and laying\\na spiteful emphasis upon the words.', 'The neighbour nodded assent.', '‘Then pray tell me where it is,’ said Kit, ‘for I have come on a\\npressing matter, and must fetch her out, even if she was in the pulpit.’\\n\\nIt was not very easy to procure a direction to the fold in question, as\\nnone of the neighbours were of the flock that resorted thither, and few\\nknew anything more of it than the name.', 'At last, a gossip of Mrs\\nNubbles’s, who had accompanied her to chapel on one or two occasions\\nwhen a comfortable cup of tea had preceded her devotions, furnished the\\nneedful information, which Kit had no sooner obtained than he started\\noff again.', 'Little Bethel might have been nearer, and might have been in a\\nstraighter road, though in that case the reverend gentleman who\\npresided over its congregation would have lost his favourite allusion\\nto the crooked ways by which it was approached, and which enabled him\\nto liken it to Paradise itself, in contradistinction to the parish\\nchurch and the broad thoroughfare leading thereunto.', 'Kit found it, at\\nlast, after some trouble, and pausing at the door to take breath that\\nhe might enter with becoming decency, passed into the chapel.', 'It was not badly named in one respect, being in truth a particularly\\nlittle Bethel--a Bethel of the smallest dimensions--with a small\\nnumber of small pews, and a small pulpit, in which a small gentleman\\n(by trade a Shoemaker, and by calling a Divine) was delivering in a by\\nno means small voice, a by no means small sermon, judging of its\\ndimensions by the condition of his audience, which, if their gross\\namount were but small, comprised a still smaller number of hearers, as\\nthe majority were slumbering.', 'Among these was Kit’s mother, who, finding it matter of extreme\\ndifficulty to keep her eyes open after the fatigues of last night, and\\nfeeling their inclination to close strongly backed and seconded by the\\narguments of the preacher, had yielded to the drowsiness that\\noverpowered her, and fallen asleep; though not so soundly but that she\\ncould, from time to time, utter a slight and almost inaudible groan, as\\nif in recognition of the orator’s doctrines.', 'The baby in her arms was\\nas fast asleep as she; and little Jacob, whose youth prevented him from\\nrecognising in this prolonged spiritual nourishment anything half as\\ninteresting as oysters, was alternately very fast asleep and very wide\\nawake, as his inclination to slumber, or his terror of being personally\\nalluded to in the discourse, gained the mastery over him.', '‘And now I’m here,’ thought Kit, gliding into the nearest empty pew\\nwhich was opposite his mother’s, and on the other side of the little\\naisle, ‘how am I ever to get at her, or persuade her to come out!', 'I\\nmight as well be twenty miles off.', 'She’ll never wake till it’s all\\nover, and there goes the clock again!', 'If he would but leave off for a\\nminute, or if they’d only sing!’\\n\\nBut there was little encouragement to believe that either event would\\nhappen for a couple of hours to come.', 'The preacher went on telling\\nthem what he meant to convince them of before he had done, and it was\\nclear that if he only kept to one-half of his promises and forgot the\\nother, he was good for that time at least.', 'In his desperation and restlessness Kit cast his eyes about the chapel,\\nand happening to let them fall upon a little seat in front of the\\nclerk’s desk, could scarcely believe them when they showed him--Quilp!', 'He rubbed them twice or thrice, but still they insisted that Quilp was\\nthere, and there indeed he was, sitting with his hands upon his knees,\\nand his hat between them on a little wooden bracket, with the\\naccustomed grin on his dirty face, and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling.', 'He certainly did not glance at Kit or at his mother, and appeared\\nutterly unconscious of their presence; still Kit could not help\\nfeeling, directly, that the attention of the sly little fiend was\\nfastened upon them, and upon nothing else.', 'But, astounded as he was by the apparition of the dwarf among the\\nLittle Bethelites, and not free from a misgiving that it was the\\nforerunner of some trouble or annoyance, he was compelled to subdue his\\nwonder and to take active measures for the withdrawal of his parent, as\\nthe evening was now creeping on, and the matter grew serious.', 'Therefore, the next time little Jacob woke, Kit set himself to attract\\nhis wandering attention, and this not being a very difficult task (one\\nsneeze effected it), he signed to him to rouse his mother.', 'Ill-luck would have it, however, that, just then, the preacher, in a\\nforcible exposition of one head of his discourse, leaned over upon the\\npulpit-desk so that very little more of him than his legs remained\\ninside; and, while he made vehement gestures with his right hand, and\\nheld on with his left, stared, or seemed to stare, straight into little\\nJacob’s eyes, threatening him by his strained look and attitude--so it\\nappeared to the child--that if he so much as moved a muscle, he, the\\npreacher, would be literally, and not figuratively, ‘down upon him’\\nthat instant.', 'In this fearful state of things, distracted by the\\nsudden appearance of Kit, and fascinated by the eyes of the preacher,\\nthe miserable Jacob sat bolt upright, wholly incapable of motion,\\nstrongly disposed to cry but afraid to do so, and returning his\\npastor’s gaze until his infant eyes seemed starting from their sockets.', '‘If I must do it openly, I must,’ thought Kit.', 'With that he walked\\nsoftly out of his pew and into his mother’s, and as Mr Swiveller would\\nhave observed if he had been present, ‘collared’ the baby without\\nspeaking a word.', '‘Hush, mother!’ whispered Kit.', '‘Come along with me, I’ve got something\\nto tell you.’\\n\\n‘Where am I?’ said Mrs Nubbles.', '‘In this blessed Little Bethel,’ returned her son, peevishly.', '‘Blessed indeed!’ cried Mrs Nubbles, catching at the word.', '‘Oh,\\nChristopher, how have I been edified this night!’\\n\\n‘Yes, yes, I know,’ said Kit hastily; ‘but come along, mother,\\neverybody’s looking at us.', 'Don’t make a noise--bring Jacob--that’s\\nright!’\\n\\n‘Stay, Satan, stay!’ cried the preacher, as Kit was moving off.', '‘This gentleman says you’re to stay, Christopher,’ whispered his mother.', '‘Stay, Satan, stay!’ roared the preacher again.', '‘Tempt not the woman\\nthat doth incline her ear to thee, but harken to the voice of him that\\ncalleth.', 'He hath a lamb from the fold!’ cried the preacher, raising\\nhis voice still higher and pointing to the baby.', '‘He beareth off a\\nlamb, a precious lamb!', 'He goeth about, like a wolf in the night\\nseason, and inveigleth the tender lambs!’\\n\\nKit was the best-tempered fellow in the world, but considering this\\nstrong language, and being somewhat excited by the circumstances in\\nwhich he was placed, he faced round to the pulpit with the baby in his\\narms, and replied aloud, ‘No, I don’t.', 'He’s my brother.’\\n\\n‘He’s MY brother!’ cried the preacher.', '‘He isn’t,’ said Kit indignantly.', '‘How can you say such a thing?', 'And\\ndon’t call me names if you please; what harm have I done?', 'I shouldn’t\\nhave come to take ‘em away, unless I was obliged, you may depend upon\\nthat.', 'I wanted to do it very quiet, but you wouldn’t let me.', 'Now, you\\nhave the goodness to abuse Satan and them, as much as you like, Sir,\\nand to let me alone if you please.’\\n\\nSo saying, Kit marched out of the chapel, followed by his mother and\\nlittle Jacob, and found himself in the open air, with an indistinct\\nrecollection of having seen the people wake up and look surprised, and\\nof Quilp having remained, throughout the interruption, in his old\\nattitude, without moving his eyes from the ceiling, or appearing to\\ntake the smallest notice of anything that passed.', '‘Oh Kit!’ said his mother, with her handkerchief to her eyes, ‘what\\nhave you done!', 'I never can go there again--never!’\\n\\n‘I’m glad of it, mother.', 'What was there in the little bit of pleasure\\nyou took last night that made it necessary for you to be low-spirited\\nand sorrowful tonight?', 'That’s the way you do.', 'If you’re happy or\\nmerry ever, you come here to say, along with that chap, that you’re\\nsorry for it.', 'More shame for you, mother, I was going to say.’\\n\\n‘Hush, dear!’ said Mrs Nubbles; ‘you don’t mean what you say I know,\\nbut you’re talking sinfulness.’\\n\\n‘Don’t mean it?', 'But I do mean it!’ retorted Kit.', '‘I don’t believe,\\nmother, that harmless cheerfulness and good humour are thought greater\\nsins in Heaven than shirt-collars are, and I do believe that those\\nchaps are just about as right and sensible in putting down the one as\\nin leaving off the other--that’s my belief.', 'But I won’t say anything\\nmore about it, if you’ll promise not to cry, that’s all; and you take\\nthe baby that’s a lighter weight, and give me little Jacob; and as we\\ngo along (which we must do pretty quick) I’ll give you the news I\\nbring, which will surprise you a little, I can tell you.', 'There--that’s\\nright.', 'Now you look as if you’d never seen Little Bethel in all your\\nlife, as I hope you never will again; and here’s the baby; and little\\nJacob, you get atop of my back and catch hold of me tight round the\\nneck, and whenever a Little Bethel parson calls you a precious lamb or\\nsays your brother’s one, you tell him it’s the truest things he’s said\\nfor a twelvemonth, and that if he’d got a little more of the lamb\\nhimself, and less of the mint-sauce--not being quite so sharp and sour\\nover it--I should like him all the better.', 'That’s what you’ve got to\\nsay to him, Jacob.’\\n\\nTalking on in this way, half in jest and half in earnest, and cheering\\nup his mother, the children, and himself, by the one simple process of\\ndetermining to be in a good humour, Kit led them briskly forward; and\\non the road home, he related what had passed at the Notary’s house, and\\nthe purpose with which he had intruded on the solemnities of Little\\nBethel.', 'His mother was not a little startled on learning what service was\\nrequired of her, and presently fell into a confusion of ideas, of which\\nthe most prominent were that it was a great honour and dignity to ride\\nin a post-chaise, and that it was a moral impossibility to leave the\\nchildren behind.', 'But this objection, and a great many others, founded\\non certain articles of dress being at the wash, and certain other\\narticles having no existence in the wardrobe of Mrs Nubbles, were\\novercome by Kit, who opposed to each and every of them, the pleasure of\\nrecovering Nell, and the delight it would be to bring her back in\\ntriumph.', '‘There’s only ten minutes now, mother,’ said Kit when they reached\\nhome.', '‘There’s a bandbox.', 'Throw in what you want, and we’ll be off\\ndirectly.’\\n\\nTo tell how Kit then hustled into the box all sorts of things which\\ncould, by no remote contingency, be wanted, and how he left out\\neverything likely to be of the smallest use; how a neighbour was\\npersuaded to come and stop with the children, and how the children at\\nfirst cried dismally, and then laughed heartily on being promised all\\nkinds of impossible and unheard-of toys; how Kit’s mother wouldn’t\\nleave off kissing them, and how Kit couldn’t make up his mind to be\\nvexed with her for doing it; would take more time and room than you and\\nI can spare.', 'So, passing over all such matters, it is sufficient to\\nsay that within a few minutes after the two hours had expired, Kit and\\nhis mother arrived at the Notary’s door, where a post-chaise was\\nalready waiting.', '‘With four horses I declare!’ said Kit, quite aghast at the\\npreparations.', '‘Well you ARE going to do it, mother!', 'Here she is, Sir.', 'Here’s my mother.', 'She’s quite ready, sir.’\\n\\n‘That’s well,’ returned the gentleman.', '‘Now, don’t be in a flutter,\\nma’am; you’ll be taken great care of.', 'Where’s the box with the new\\nclothing and necessaries for them?’\\n\\n‘Here it is,’ said the Notary.', '‘In with it, Christopher.’\\n\\n‘All right, Sir,’ replied Kit.', '‘Quite ready now, sir.’\\n\\n‘Then come along,’ said the single gentleman.', 'And thereupon he gave\\nhis arm to Kit’s mother, handed her into the carriage as politely as\\nyou please, and took his seat beside her.', 'Up went the steps, bang went the door, round whirled the wheels, and\\noff they rattled, with Kit’s mother hanging out at one window waving a\\ndamp pocket-handkerchief and screaming out a great many messages to\\nlittle Jacob and the baby, of which nobody heard a word.', 'Kit stood in the middle of the road, and looked after them with tears\\nin his eyes--not brought there by the departure he witnessed, but by\\nthe return to which he looked forward.', '‘They went away,’ he thought,\\n‘on foot with nobody to speak to them or say a kind word at parting,\\nand they’ll come back, drawn by four horses, with this rich gentleman\\nfor their friend, and all their troubles over!', 'She’ll forget that she\\ntaught me to write--’\\n\\nWhatever Kit thought about after this, took some time to think of, for\\nhe stood gazing up the lines of shining lamps, long after the chaise\\nhad disappeared, and did not return into the house until the Notary and\\nMr Abel, who had themselves lingered outside till the sound of the\\nwheels was no longer distinguishable, had several times wondered what\\ncould possibly detain him.', 'CHAPTER 42\\n\\nIt behoves us to leave Kit for a while, thoughtful and expectant, and\\nto follow the fortunes of little Nell; resuming the thread of the\\nnarrative at the point where it was left, some chapters back.', 'In one of those wanderings in the evening time, when, following the two\\nsisters at a humble distance, she felt, in her sympathy with them and\\nher recognition in their trials of something akin to her own loneliness\\nof spirit, a comfort and consolation which made such moments a time of\\ndeep delight, though the softened pleasure they yielded was of that\\nkind which lives and dies in tears--in one of those wanderings at the\\nquiet hour of twilight, when sky, and earth, and air, and rippling\\nwater, and sound of distant bells, claimed kindred with the emotions of\\nthe solitary child, and inspired her with soothing thoughts, but not of\\na child’s world or its easy joys--in one of those rambles which had now\\nbecome her only pleasure or relief from care, light had faded into\\ndarkness and evening deepened into night, and still the young creature\\nlingered in the gloom; feeling a companionship in Nature so serene and\\nstill, when noise of tongues and glare of garish lights would have been\\nsolitude indeed.', 'The sisters had gone home, and she was alone.', 'She raised her eyes to\\nthe bright stars, looking down so mildly from the wide worlds of air,\\nand, gazing on them, found new stars burst upon her view, and more\\nbeyond, and more beyond again, until the whole great expanse sparkled\\nwith shining spheres, rising higher and higher in immeasurable space,\\neternal in their numbers as in their changeless and incorruptible\\nexistence.', 'She bent over the calm river, and saw them shining in the\\nsame majestic order as when the dove beheld them gleaming through the\\nswollen waters, upon the mountain tops down far below, and dead\\nmankind, a million fathoms deep.', 'The child sat silently beneath a tree, hushed in her very breath by the\\nstillness of the night, and all its attendant wonders.', 'The time and\\nplace awoke reflection, and she thought with a quiet hope--less hope,\\nperhaps, than resignation--on the past, and present, and what was yet\\nbefore her.', 'Between the old man and herself there had come a gradual\\nseparation, harder to bear than any former sorrow.', 'Every evening, and\\noften in the day-time too, he was absent, alone; and although she well\\nknew where he went, and why--too well from the constant drain upon her\\nscanty purse and from his haggard looks--he evaded all inquiry,\\nmaintained a strict reserve, and even shunned her presence.', 'She sat meditating sorrowfully upon this change, and mingling it, as it\\nwere, with everything about her, when the distant church-clock bell\\nstruck nine.', 'Rising at the sound, she retraced her steps, and turned\\nthoughtfully towards the town.', 'She had gained a little wooden bridge, which, thrown across the stream,\\nled into a meadow in her way, when she came suddenly upon a ruddy\\nlight, and looking forward more attentively, discerned that it\\nproceeded from what appeared to be an encampment of gipsies, who had\\nmade a fire in one corner at no great distance from the path, and were\\nsitting or lying round it.', 'As she was too poor to have any fear of\\nthem, she did not alter her course (which, indeed, she could not have\\ndone without going a long way round), but quickened her pace a little,\\nand kept straight on.', 'A movement of timid curiosity impelled her, when she approached the\\nspot, to glance towards the fire.', 'There was a form between it and her,\\nthe outline strongly developed against the light, which caused her to\\nstop abruptly.', 'Then, as if she had reasoned with herself and were\\nassured that it could not be, or had satisfied herself that it was not\\nthat of the person she had supposed, she went on again.', 'But at that instant the conversation, whatever it was, which had been\\ncarrying on near this fire was resumed, and the tones of the voice that\\nspoke--she could not distinguish words--sounded as familiar to her as\\nher own.', 'She turned, and looked back.', 'The person had been seated before, but\\nwas now in a standing posture, and leaning forward on a stick on which\\nhe rested both hands.', 'The attitude was no less familiar to her than\\nthe tone of voice had been.', 'It was her grandfather.', 'Her first impulse was to call to him; her next to wonder who his\\nassociates could be, and for what purpose they were together.', 'Some\\nvague apprehension succeeded, and, yielding to the strong inclination\\nit awakened, she drew nearer to the place; not advancing across the\\nopen field, however, but creeping towards it by the hedge.', 'In this way she advanced within a few feet of the fire, and standing\\namong a few young trees, could both see and hear, without much danger\\nof being observed.', 'There were no women or children, as she had seen in other gipsy camps\\nthey had passed in their wayfaring, and but one gipsy--a tall athletic\\nman, who stood with his arms folded, leaning against a tree at a little\\ndistance off, looking now at the fire, and now, under his black\\neyelashes, at three other men who were there, with a watchful but\\nhalf-concealed interest in their conversation.', 'Of these, her\\ngrandfather was one; the others she recognised as the first\\ncard-players at the public-house on the eventful night of the\\nstorm--the man whom they had called Isaac List, and his gruff\\ncompanion.', 'One of the low, arched gipsy-tents, common to that people,\\nwas pitched hard by, but it either was, or appeared to be, empty.', '‘Well, are you going?’ said the stout man, looking up from the ground\\nwhere he was lying at his ease, into her grandfather’s face.', '‘You were\\nin a mighty hurry a minute ago.', 'Go, if you like.', 'You’re your own\\nmaster, I hope?’\\n\\n‘Don’t vex him,’ returned Isaac List, who was squatting like a frog on\\nthe other side of the fire, and had so screwed himself up that he\\nseemed to be squinting all over; ‘he didn’t mean any offence.’\\n\\n‘You keep me poor, and plunder me, and make a sport and jest of me\\nbesides,’ said the old man, turning from one to the other.', '‘Ye’ll\\ndrive me mad among ye.’\\n\\nThe utter irresolution and feebleness of the grey-haired child,\\ncontrasted with the keen and cunning looks of those in whose hands he\\nwas, smote upon the little listener’s heart.', 'But she constrained\\nherself to attend to all that passed, and to note each look and word.', '‘Confound you, what do you mean?’ said the stout man rising a little,\\nand supporting himself on his elbow.', '‘Keep you poor!', 'You’d keep us\\npoor if you could, wouldn’t you?', 'That’s the way with you whining,\\npuny, pitiful players.', 'When you lose, you’re martyrs; but I don’t find\\nthat when you win, you look upon the other losers in that light.', 'As to\\nplunder!’ cried the fellow, raising his voice--‘Damme, what do you\\nmean by such ungentlemanly language as plunder, eh?’\\n\\nThe speaker laid himself down again at full length, and gave one or two\\nshort, angry kicks, as if in further expression of his unbounded\\nindignation.', 'It was quite plain that he acted the bully, and his\\nfriend the peacemaker, for some particular purpose; or rather, it would\\nhave been to any one but the weak old man; for they exchanged glances\\nquite openly, both with each other and with the gipsy, who grinned his\\napproval of the jest until his white teeth shone again.', 'The old man stood helplessly among them for a little time, and then\\nsaid, turning to his assailant:\\n\\n‘You yourself were speaking of plunder just now, you know.', 'Don’t be so\\nviolent with me.', 'You were, were you not?’\\n\\n‘Not of plundering among present company!', 'Honour among--among\\ngentlemen, Sir,’ returned the other, who seemed to have been very near\\ngiving an awkward termination to the sentence.', '‘Don’t be hard upon him, Jowl,’ said Isaac List.', '‘He’s very sorry for\\ngiving offence.', 'There--go on with what you were saying--go on.’\\n\\n‘I’m a jolly old tender-hearted lamb, I am,’ cried Mr Jowl, ‘to be\\nsitting here at my time of life giving advice when I know it won’t be\\ntaken, and that I shall get nothing but abuse for my pains.', 'But that’s\\nthe way I’ve gone through life.', 'Experience has never put a chill upon\\nmy warm-heartedness.’\\n\\n‘I tell you he’s very sorry, don’t I?’ remonstrated Isaac List, ‘and\\nthat he wishes you’d go on.’\\n\\n‘Does he wish it?’ said the other.', '‘Ay,’ groaned the old man sitting down, and rocking himself to and fro.', '‘Go on, go on.', 'It’s in vain to fight with it; I can’t do it; go on.’\\n\\n‘I go on then,’ said Jowl, ‘where I left off, when you got up so quick.', 'If you’re persuaded that it’s time for luck to turn, as it certainly\\nis, and find that you haven’t means enough to try it (and that’s where\\nit is, for you know, yourself, that you never have the funds to keep on\\nlong enough at a sitting), help yourself to what seems put in your way\\non purpose.', 'Borrow it, I say, and, when you’re able, pay it back\\nagain.’\\n\\n‘Certainly,’ Isaac List struck in, ‘if this good lady as keeps the\\nwax-works has money, and does keep it in a tin box when she goes to\\nbed, and doesn’t lock her door for fear of fire, it seems a easy thing;\\nquite a Providence, I should call it--but then I’ve been religiously\\nbrought up.’\\n\\n‘You see, Isaac,’ said his friend, growing more eager, and drawing\\nhimself closer to the old man, while he signed to the gipsy not to come\\nbetween them; ‘you see, Isaac, strangers are going in and out every\\nhour of the day; nothing would be more likely than for one of these\\nstrangers to get under the good lady’s bed, or lock himself in the\\ncupboard; suspicion would be very wide, and would fall a long way from\\nthe mark, no doubt.', 'I’d give him his revenge to the last farthing he\\nbrought, whatever the amount was.’\\n\\n‘But could you?’ urged Isaac List.', '‘Is your bank strong enough?’\\n\\n‘Strong enough!’ answered the other, with assumed disdain.', '‘Here, you\\nSir, give me that box out of the straw!’\\n\\nThis was addressed to the gipsy, who crawled into the low tent on all\\nfours, and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cash-box,\\nwhich the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person.', '‘Do you see this?’ he said, gathering up the money in his hand and\\nletting it drop back into the box, between his fingers, like water.', '‘Do you hear it?', 'Do you know the sound of gold?', 'There, put it\\nback--and don’t talk about banks again, Isaac, till you’ve got one of\\nyour own.’\\n\\nIsaac List, with great apparent humility, protested that he had never\\ndoubted the credit of a gentleman so notorious for his honourable\\ndealing as Mr Jowl, and that he had hinted at the production of the\\nbox, not for the satisfaction of his doubts, for he could have none,\\nbut with a view to being regaled with a sight of so much wealth, which,\\nthough it might be deemed by some but an unsubstantial and visionary\\npleasure, was to one in his circumstances a source of extreme delight,\\nonly to be surpassed by its safe depository in his own personal\\npockets.', 'Although Mr List and Mr Jowl addressed themselves to each\\nother, it was remarkable that they both looked narrowly at the old man,\\nwho, with his eyes fixed upon the fire, sat brooding over it, yet\\nlistening eagerly--as it seemed from a certain involuntary motion of\\nthe head, or twitching of the face from time to time--to all they said.', '‘My advice,’ said Jowl, lying down again with a careless air, ‘is\\nplain--I have given it, in fact.', 'I act as a friend.', 'Why should I help\\na man to the means perhaps of winning all I have, unless I considered\\nhim my friend?', 'It’s foolish, I dare say, to be so thoughtful of the\\nwelfare of other people, but that’s my constitution, and I can’t help\\nit; so don’t blame me, Isaac List.’\\n\\n‘I blame you!’ returned the person addressed; ‘not for the world, Mr\\nJowl.', 'I wish I could afford to be as liberal as you; and, as you say,\\nhe might pay it back if he won--and if he lost--’\\n\\n‘You’re not to take that into consideration at all,’ said Jowl.', '‘But suppose he did (and nothing’s less likely, from all I know of\\nchances), why, it’s better to lose other people’s money than one’s own,\\nI hope?’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ cried Isaac List rapturously, ‘the pleasures of winning!', 'The\\ndelight of picking up the money--the bright, shining yellow-boys--and\\nsweeping ‘em into one’s pocket!', 'The deliciousness of having a triumph\\nat last, and thinking that one didn’t stop short and turn back, but\\nwent half-way to meet it!', 'The--but you’re not going, old gentleman?’\\n\\n‘I’ll do it,’ said the old man, who had risen and taken two or three\\nhurried steps away, and now returned as hurriedly.', '‘I’ll have it,\\nevery penny.’\\n\\n‘Why, that’s brave,’ cried Isaac, jumping up and slapping him on the\\nshoulder; ‘and I respect you for having so much young blood left.', 'Ha,\\nha, ha!', 'Joe Jowl’s half sorry he advised you now.', 'We’ve got the laugh\\nagainst him.', 'Ha, ha, ha!’\\n\\n‘He gives me my revenge, mind,’ said the old man, pointing to him\\neagerly with his shrivelled hand: ‘mind--he stakes coin against coin,\\ndown to the last one in the box, be there many or few.', 'Remember that!’\\n\\n‘I’m witness,’ returned Isaac.', '‘I’ll see fair between you.’\\n\\n‘I have passed my word,’ said Jowl with feigned reluctance, ‘and I’ll\\nkeep it.', 'When does this match come off?', 'I wish it was over.--To-night?’\\n\\n‘I must have the money first,’ said the old man; ‘and that I’ll have\\nto-morrow--’\\n\\n‘Why not to-night?’ urged Jowl.', '‘It’s late now, and I should be flushed and flurried,’ said the old\\nman.', '‘It must be softly done.', 'No, to-morrow night.’\\n\\n‘Then to-morrow be it,’ said Jowl.', '‘A drop of comfort here.', 'Luck to\\nthe best man!', 'Fill!’\\n\\nThe gipsy produced three tin cups, and filled them to the brim with\\nbrandy.', 'The old man turned aside and muttered to himself before he\\ndrank.', 'Her own name struck upon the listener’s ear, coupled with some\\nwish so fervent, that he seemed to breathe it in an agony of\\nsupplication.', '‘God be merciful to us!’ cried the child within herself, ‘and help us\\nin this trying hour!', 'What shall I do to save him!’\\n\\nThe remainder of their conversation was carried on in a lower tone of\\nvoice, and was sufficiently concise; relating merely to the execution\\nof the project, and the best precautions for diverting suspicion.', 'The\\nold man then shook hands with his tempters, and withdrew.', 'They watched his bowed and stooping figure as it retreated slowly, and\\nwhen he turned his head to look back, which he often did, waved their\\nhands, or shouted some brief encouragement.', 'It was not until they had\\nseen him gradually diminish into a mere speck upon the distant road,\\nthat they turned to each other, and ventured to laugh aloud.', '‘So,’ said Jowl, warming his hands at the fire, ‘it’s done at last.', 'He\\nwanted more persuading than I expected.', 'It’s three weeks ago, since we\\nfirst put this in his head.', 'What’ll he bring, do you think?’\\n\\n‘Whatever he brings, it’s halved between us,’ returned Isaac List.', 'The other man nodded.', '‘We must make quick work of it,’ he said, ‘and\\nthen cut his acquaintance, or we may be suspected.', 'Sharp’s the word.’\\n\\nList and the gipsy acquiesced.', 'When they had all three amused\\nthemselves a little with their victim’s infatuation, they dismissed the\\nsubject as one which had been sufficiently discussed, and began to talk\\nin a jargon which the child did not understand.', 'As their discourse\\nappeared to relate to matters in which they were warmly interested,\\nhowever, she deemed it the best time for escaping unobserved; and crept\\naway with slow and cautious steps, keeping in the shadow of the hedges,\\nor forcing a path through them or the dry ditches, until she could\\nemerge upon the road at a point beyond their range of vision.', 'Then she\\nfled homeward as quickly as she could, torn and bleeding from the\\nwounds of thorns and briars, but more lacerated in mind, and threw\\nherself upon her bed, distracted.', 'The first idea that flashed upon her mind was flight, instant flight;\\ndragging him from that place, and rather dying of want upon the\\nroadside, than ever exposing him again to such terrible temptations.', 'Then, she remembered that the crime was not to be committed until next\\nnight, and there was the intermediate time for thinking, and resolving\\nwhat to do.', 'Then, she was distracted with a horrible fear that he\\nmight be committing it at that moment; with a dread of hearing shrieks\\nand cries piercing the silence of the night; with fearful thoughts of\\nwhat he might be tempted and led on to do, if he were detected in the\\nact, and had but a woman to struggle with.', 'It was impossible to bear\\nsuch torture.', 'She stole to the room where the money was, opened the\\ndoor, and looked in.', 'God be praised!', 'He was not there, and she was\\nsleeping soundly.', 'She went back to her own room, and tried to prepare herself for bed.', 'But who could sleep--sleep!', 'who could lie passively down, distracted by\\nsuch terrors?', 'They came upon her more and more strongly yet.', 'Half\\nundressed, and with her hair in wild disorder, she flew to the old\\nman’s bedside, clasped him by the wrist, and roused him from his sleep.', '‘What’s this!’ he cried, starting up in bed, and fixing his eyes upon\\nher spectral face.', '‘I have had a dreadful dream,’ said the child, with an energy that\\nnothing but such terrors could have inspired.', '‘A dreadful, horrible\\ndream.', 'I have had it once before.', 'It is a dream of grey-haired men\\nlike you, in darkened rooms by night, robbing sleepers of their gold.', 'Up, up!’\\n\\nThe old man shook in every joint, and folded his hands like one who\\nprays.', '‘Not to me,’ said the child, ‘not to me--to Heaven, to save us from\\nsuch deeds!', 'This dream is too real.', 'I cannot sleep, I cannot stay\\nhere, I cannot leave you alone under the roof where such dreams come.', 'Up!', 'We must fly.’\\n\\nHe looked at her as if she were a spirit--she might have been for all\\nthe look of earth she had--and trembled more and more.', '‘There is no time to lose; I will not lose one minute,’ said the child.', '‘Up!', 'and away with me!’\\n\\n‘To-night?’ murmured the old man.', '‘Yes, to-night,’ replied the child.', '‘To-morrow night will be too late.', 'The dream will have come again.', 'Nothing but flight can save us.', 'Up!’\\n\\nThe old man rose from his bed: his forehead bedewed with the cold sweat\\nof fear: and, bending before the child as if she had been an angel\\nmessenger sent to lead him where she would, made ready to follow her.', 'She took him by the hand and led him on.', 'As they passed the door of the\\nroom he had proposed to rob, she  shuddered and looked up into his\\nface.', 'What a white face was that, and with what a look did he meet\\nhers!', 'She took him to her own chamber, and, still holding him by the hand as\\nif she feared to lose him for an instant, gathered together the little\\nstock she had, and hung her basket on her arm.', 'The old man took his\\nwallet from her hands and strapped it on his shoulders--his staff,\\ntoo, she had brought away--and then she led him forth.', 'Through the strait streets, and narrow crooked outskirts, their\\ntrembling feet passed quickly.', 'Up the steep hill too, crowned by the\\nold grey castle, they toiled with rapid steps, and had not once looked\\nbehind.', 'But as they drew nearer the ruined walls, the moon rose in all her\\ngentle glory, and, from their venerable age, garlanded with ivy, moss,\\nand waving grass, the child looked back upon the sleeping town, deep in\\nthe valley’s shade: and on the far-off river with its winding track of\\nlight: and on the distant hills; and as she did so, she clasped the\\nhand she held, less firmly, and bursting into tears, fell upon the old\\nman’s neck.', 'CHAPTER 43\\n\\nHer momentary weakness past, the child again summoned the resolution\\nwhich had until now sustained her, and, endeavouring to keep steadily\\nin her view the one idea that they were flying from disgrace and crime,\\nand that her grandfather’s preservation must depend solely on her\\nfirmness, unaided by one word of advice or any helping hand, urged him\\nonward and looked back no more.', 'While he, subdued and abashed, seemed to crouch before her, and to\\nshrink and cower down, as if in the presence of some superior creature,\\nthe child herself was sensible of a new feeling within her, which\\nelevated her nature, and inspired her with an energy and confidence she\\nhad never known.', 'There was no divided responsibility now; the whole\\nburden of their two lives had fallen upon her, and henceforth she must\\nthink and act for both.', '‘I have saved him,’ she thought.', '‘In all\\ndangers and distresses, I will remember that.’\\n\\nAt any other time, the recollection of having deserted the friend who\\nhad shown them so much homely kindness, without a word of\\njustification--the thought that they were guilty, in appearance, of\\ntreachery and ingratitude--even the having parted from the two\\nsisters--would have filled her with sorrow and regret.', 'But now, all\\nother considerations were lost in the new uncertainties and anxieties\\nof their wild and wandering life; and the very desperation of their\\ncondition roused and stimulated her.', 'In the pale moonlight, which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate\\nface where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and\\nloveliness of youth, the too bright eye, the spiritual head, the lips\\nthat pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the\\nheart, the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak, told\\ntheir silent tale; but told it only to the wind that rustled by, which,\\ntaking up its burden, carried, perhaps to some mother’s pillow, faint\\ndreams of childhood fading in its bloom, and resting in the sleep that\\nknows no waking.', 'The night crept on apace, the moon went down, the stars grew pale and\\ndim, and morning, cold as they, slowly approached.', 'Then, from behind a\\ndistant hill, the noble sun rose up, driving the mists in phantom\\nshapes before it, and clearing the earth of their ghostly forms till\\ndarkness came again.', 'When it had climbed higher into the sky, and\\nthere was warmth in its cheerful beams, they laid them down to sleep,\\nupon a bank, hard by some water.', 'But Nell retained her grasp upon the old man’s arm, and long after he\\nwas slumbering soundly, watched him with untiring eyes.', 'Fatigue stole\\nover her at last; her grasp relaxed, tightened, relaxed again, and they\\nslept side by side.', 'A confused sound of voices, mingling with her dreams, awoke her.', 'A man\\nof very uncouth and rough appearance was standing over them, and two of\\nhis companions were looking on, from a long heavy boat which had come\\nclose to the bank while they were sleeping.', 'The boat had neither oar\\nnor sail, but was towed by a couple of horses, who, with the rope to\\nwhich they were harnessed slack and dripping in the water, were resting\\non the path.', '‘Holloa!’ said the man roughly.', '‘What’s the matter here?’\\n\\n‘We were only asleep, Sir,’ said Nell.', '‘We have been walking all\\nnight.’\\n\\n‘A pair of queer travellers to be walking all night,’ observed the man\\nwho had first accosted them.', '‘One of you is a trifle too old for that\\nsort of work, and the other a trifle too young.', 'Where are you going?’\\n\\nNell faltered, and pointed at hazard towards the West, upon which the\\nman inquired if she meant a certain town which he named.', 'Nell, to\\navoid more questioning, said ‘Yes, that was the place.’\\n\\n‘Where have you come from?’ was the next question; and this being an\\neasier one to answer, Nell mentioned the name of the village in which\\ntheir friend the schoolmaster dwelt, as being less likely to be known\\nto the men or to provoke further inquiry.', '‘I thought somebody had been robbing and ill-using you, might be,’ said\\nthe man.', '‘That’s all.', 'Good day.’\\n\\nReturning his salute and feeling greatly relieved by his departure,\\nNell looked after him as he mounted one of the horses, and the boat\\nwent on.', 'It had not gone very far, when it stopped again, and she saw\\nthe men beckoning to her.', '‘Did you call to me?’ said Nell, running up to them.', '‘You may go with us if you like,’ replied one of those in the boat.', '‘We’re going to the same place.’\\n\\nThe child hesitated for a moment.', 'Thinking, as she had thought with\\ngreat trepidation more than once before, that the men whom she had seen\\nwith her grandfather might, perhaps, in their eagerness for the booty,\\nfollow them, and regaining their influence over him, set hers at\\nnought; and that if they went with these men, all traces of them must\\nsurely be lost at that spot; determined to accept the offer.', 'The boat\\ncame close to the bank again, and before she had had any more time for\\nconsideration, she and her grandfather were on board, and gliding\\nsmoothly down the canal.', 'The sun shone pleasantly on the bright water, which was sometimes\\nshaded by trees, and sometimes open to a wide extent of country,\\nintersected by running streams, and rich with wooded hills, cultivated\\nland, and sheltered farms.', 'Now and then, a village with its modest\\nspire, thatched roofs, and gable-ends, would peep out from among the\\ntrees; and, more than once, a distant town, with great church towers\\nlooming through its smoke, and high factories or workshops rising above\\nthe mass of houses, would come in view, and, by the length of time it\\nlingered in the distance, show them how slowly they travelled.', 'Their\\nway lay, for the most part, through the low grounds, and open plains;\\nand except these distant places, and occasionally some men working in\\nthe fields, or lounging on the bridges under which they passed, to see\\nthem creep along, nothing encroached on their monotonous and secluded\\ntrack.', 'Nell was rather disheartened, when they stopped at a kind of wharf late\\nin the afternoon, to learn from one of the men that they would not\\nreach their place of destination until next day, and that, if she had\\nno provision with her, she had better buy it there.', 'She had but a few\\npence, having already bargained with them for some bread, but even of\\nthese it was necessary to be very careful, as they were on their way to\\nan utterly strange place, with no resource whatever.', 'A small loaf and\\na morsel of cheese, therefore, were all she could afford, and with\\nthese she took her place in the boat again, and, after half an hour’s\\ndelay during which the men were drinking at the public-house, proceeded\\non the journey.', 'They brought some beer and spirits into the boat with them, and what\\nwith drinking freely before, and again now, were soon in a fair way of\\nbeing quarrelsome and intoxicated.', 'Avoiding the small cabin,\\ntherefore, which was very dark and filthy, and to which they often\\ninvited both her and her grandfather, Nell sat in the open air with the\\nold man by her side: listening to their boisterous hosts with a\\npalpitating heart, and almost wishing herself safe on shore again\\nthough she should have to walk all night.', 'They were, in truth, very rugged, noisy fellows, and quite brutal among\\nthemselves, though civil enough to their two passengers.', 'Thus, when a\\nquarrel arose between the man who was steering and his friend in the\\ncabin, upon the question who had first suggested the propriety of\\noffering Nell some beer, and when the quarrel led to a scuffle in which\\nthey beat each other fearfully, to her inexpressible terror, neither\\nvisited his displeasure upon her, but each contented himself with\\nventing it on his adversary, on whom, in addition to blows, he bestowed\\na variety of compliments, which, happily for the child, were conveyed\\nin terms, to her quite unintelligible.', 'The difference was finally\\nadjusted, by the man who had come out of the cabin knocking the other\\ninto it head first, and taking the helm into his own hands, without\\nevincing the least discomposure himself, or causing any in his friend,\\nwho, being of a tolerably strong constitution and perfectly inured to\\nsuch trifles, went to sleep as he was, with his heels upwards, and in a\\ncouple of minutes or so was snoring comfortably.', 'By this time it was night again, and though the child felt cold, being\\nbut poorly clad, her anxious thoughts were far removed from her own\\nsuffering or uneasiness, and busily engaged in endeavouring to devise\\nsome scheme for their joint subsistence.', 'The same spirit which had\\nsupported her on the previous night, upheld and sustained her now.', 'Her\\ngrandfather lay sleeping safely at her side, and the crime to which his\\nmadness urged him, was not committed.', 'That was her comfort.', 'How every circumstance of her short, eventful life, came thronging into\\nher mind, as they travelled on!', 'Slight incidents, never thought of or\\nremembered until now; faces, seen once and ever since forgotten; words\\nscarcely heeded at the time; scenes, of a year ago and those of\\nyesterday, mixing up and linking themselves together; familiar places\\nshaping themselves out in the darkness from things which, when\\napproached, were, of all others, the most remote and most unlike them;\\nsometimes, a strange confusion in her mind relative to the occasion of\\nher being there, and the place to which she was going, and the people\\nshe was with; and imagination suggesting remarks and questions which\\nsounded so plainly in her ears, that she would start, and turn, and be\\nalmost tempted to reply;--all the fancies and contradictions common in\\nwatching and excitement and restless change of place, beset the child.', 'She happened, while she was thus engaged, to encounter the face of the\\nman on deck, in whom the sentimental stage of drunkenness had now\\nsucceeded to the boisterous, and who, taking from his mouth a short\\npipe, quilted over with string for its longer preservation, requested\\nthat she would oblige him with a song.', '‘You’ve got a very pretty voice, a very soft eye, and a very strong\\nmemory,’ said this gentleman; ‘the voice and eye I’ve got evidence for,\\nand the memory’s an opinion of my own.', 'And I’m never wrong.', 'Let me\\nhear a song this minute.’\\n\\n‘I don’t think I know one, sir,’ returned Nell.', '‘You know forty-seven songs,’ said the man, with a gravity which\\nadmitted of no altercation on the subject.', '‘Forty-seven’s your number.', 'Let me hear one of ‘em--the best.', 'Give me a song this minute.’\\n\\nNot knowing what might be the consequences of irritating her friend,\\nand trembling with the fear of doing so, poor Nell sang him some little\\nditty which she had learned in happier times, and which was so\\nagreeable to his ear, that on its conclusion he in the same peremptory\\nmanner requested to be favoured with another, to which he was so\\nobliging as to roar a chorus to no particular tune, and with no words\\nat all, but which amply made up in its amazing energy for its\\ndeficiency in other respects.', 'The noise of this vocal performance\\nawakened the other man, who, staggering upon deck and shaking his late\\nopponent by the hand, swore that singing was his pride and joy and\\nchief delight, and that he desired no better entertainment.', 'With a\\nthird call, more imperative than either of the two former, Nell felt\\nobliged to comply, and this time a chorus was maintained not only by\\nthe two men together, but also by the third man on horseback, who being\\nby his position debarred from a nearer participation in the revels of\\nthe night, roared when his companions roared, and rent the very air.', 'In this way, with little cessation, and singing the same songs again\\nand again, the tired and exhausted child kept them in good humour all\\nthat night; and many a cottager, who was roused from his soundest sleep\\nby the discordant chorus as it floated away upon the wind, hid his head\\nbeneath the bed-clothes and trembled at the sounds.', 'At length the morning dawned.', 'It was no sooner light than it began to\\nrain heavily.', 'As the child could not endure the intolerable vapours of\\nthe cabin, they covered her, in return for her exertions, with some\\npieces of sail-cloth and ends of tarpaulin, which sufficed to keep her\\ntolerably dry and to shelter her grandfather besides.', 'As the day\\nadvanced the rain increased.', 'At noon it poured down more hopelessly\\nand heavily than ever without the faintest promise of abatement.', 'They had, for some time, been gradually approaching the place for which\\nthey were bound.', 'The water had become thicker and dirtier; other\\nbarges, coming from it, passed them frequently; the paths of coal-ash\\nand huts of staring brick, marked the vicinity of some great\\nmanufacturing town; while scattered streets and houses, and smoke from\\ndistant furnaces, indicated that they were already in the outskirts.', 'Now, the clustered roofs, and piles of buildings, trembling with the\\nworking of engines, and dimly resounding with their shrieks and\\nthrobbings; the tall chimneys vomiting forth a black vapour, which hung\\nin a dense ill-favoured cloud above the housetops and filled the air\\nwith gloom; the clank of hammers beating upon iron, the roar of busy\\nstreets and noisy crowds, gradually augmenting until all the various\\nsounds blended into one and none was distinguishable for itself,\\nannounced the termination of their journey.', 'The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged.', 'The men were\\noccupied directly.', 'The child and her grandfather, after waiting in\\nvain to thank them or ask them whither they should go, passed through a\\ndirty lane into a crowded street, and stood, amid its din and tumult,\\nand in the pouring rain, as strange, bewildered, and confused, as if\\nthey had lived a thousand years before, and were raised from the dead\\nand placed there by a miracle.', 'CHAPTER 44\\n\\nThe throng of people hurried by, in two opposite streams, with no\\nsymptom of cessation or exhaustion; intent upon their own affairs; and\\nundisturbed in their business speculations, by the roar of carts and\\nwaggons laden with clashing wares, the slipping of horses’ feet upon\\nthe wet and greasy pavement, the rattling of the rain on windows and\\numbrella-tops, the jostling of the more impatient passengers, and all\\nthe noise and tumult of a crowded street in the high tide of its\\noccupation: while the two poor strangers, stunned and bewildered by the\\nhurry they beheld but had no part in, looked mournfully on; feeling,\\namidst the crowd, a solitude which has no parallel but in the thirst of\\nthe shipwrecked mariner, who, tost to and fro upon the billows of a\\nmighty ocean, his red eyes blinded by looking on the water which hems\\nhim in on every side, has not one drop to cool his burning tongue.', 'They withdrew into a low archway for shelter from the rain, and watched\\nthe faces of those who passed, to find in one among them a ray of\\nencouragement or hope.', 'Some frowned, some smiled, some muttered to\\nthemselves, some made slight gestures, as if anticipating the\\nconversation in which they would shortly be engaged, some wore the\\ncunning look of bargaining and plotting, some were anxious and eager,\\nsome slow and dull; in some countenances, were written gain; in others,\\nloss.', 'It was like being in the confidence of all these people to stand\\nquietly there, looking into their faces as they flitted past.', 'In busy\\nplaces, where each man has an object of his own, and feels assured that\\nevery other man has his, his character and purpose are written broadly\\nin his face.', 'In the public walks and lounges of a town, people go to\\nsee and to be seen, and there the same expression, with little variety,\\nis repeated a hundred times.', 'The working-day faces come nearer to the\\ntruth, and let it out more plainly.', 'Falling into that kind of abstraction which such a solitude awakens,\\nthe child continued to gaze upon the passing crowd with a wondering\\ninterest, amounting almost to a temporary forgetfulness of her own\\ncondition.', 'But cold, wet, hunger, want of rest, and lack of any place\\nin which to lay her aching head, soon brought her thoughts back to the\\npoint whence they had strayed.', 'No one passed who seemed to notice\\nthem, or to whom she durst appeal.', 'After some time, they left their\\nplace of refuge from the weather, and mingled with the concourse.', 'Evening came on.', 'They were still wandering up and down, with fewer\\npeople about them, but with the same sense of solitude in their own\\nbreasts, and the same indifference from all around.', 'The lights in the\\nstreets and shops made them feel yet more desolate, for with their\\nhelp, night and darkness seemed to come on faster.', 'Shivering with the\\ncold and damp, ill in body, and sick to death at heart, the child\\nneeded her utmost firmness and resolution even to creep along.', 'Why had they ever come to this noisy town, when there were peaceful\\ncountry places, in which, at least, they might have hungered and\\nthirsted, with less suffering than in its squalid strife!', 'They were\\nbut an atom, here, in a mountain heap of misery, the very sight of\\nwhich increased their hopelessness and suffering.', 'The child had not only to endure the accumulated hardships of their\\ndestitute condition, but to bear the reproaches of her grandfather, who\\nbegan to murmur at having been led away from their late abode, and\\ndemand that they should return to it.', 'Being now penniless, and no\\nrelief or prospect of relief appearing, they retraced their steps\\nthrough the deserted streets, and went back to the wharf, hoping to\\nfind the boat in which they had come, and to be allowed to sleep on\\nboard that night.', 'But here again they were disappointed, for the gate\\nwas closed, and some fierce dogs, barking at their approach, obliged\\nthem to retreat.', '‘We must sleep in the open air to-night, dear,’ said the child in a\\nweak voice, as they turned away from this last repulse; ‘and to-morrow\\nwe will beg our way to some quiet part of the country, and try to earn\\nour bread in very humble work.’\\n\\n‘Why did you bring me here?’ returned the old man fiercely.', '‘I cannot\\nbear these close eternal streets.', 'We came from a quiet part.', 'Why did\\nyou force me to leave it?’\\n\\n‘Because I must have that dream I told you of, no more,’ said the\\nchild, with a momentary firmness that lost itself in tears; ‘and we\\nmust live among poor people, or it will come again.', 'Dear grandfather,\\nyou are old and weak, I know; but look at me.', 'I never will complain if\\nyou will not, but I have some suffering indeed.’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'poor, houseless, wandering, motherless child!’ cried the old man,\\nclasping his hands and gazing as if for the first time upon her anxious\\nface, her travel-stained dress, and bruised and swollen feet; ‘has all\\nmy agony of care brought her to this at last!', 'Was I a happy man once,\\nand have I lost happiness and all I had, for this!’\\n\\n‘If we were in the country now,’ said the child, with assumed\\ncheerfulness, as they walked on looking about them for a shelter, we\\nshould find some good old tree, stretching out his green arms as if he\\nloved us, and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep,\\nthinking of him while he watched.', 'Please God, we shall be there\\nsoon--to-morrow or next day at the farthest--and in the meantime let us\\nthink, dear, that it was a good thing we came here; for we are lost in\\nthe crowd and hurry of this place, and if any cruel people should\\npursue us, they could surely never trace us further.', 'There’s comfort\\nin that.', 'And here’s a deep old doorway--very dark, but quite dry, and\\nwarm too, for the wind don’t blow in here--What’s that!’\\n\\nUttering a half shriek, she recoiled from a black figure which came\\nsuddenly out of the dark recess in which they were about to take\\nrefuge, and stood still, looking at them.', '‘Speak again,’ it said; ‘do I know the voice?’\\n\\n‘No,’ replied the child timidly; ‘we are strangers, and having no money\\nfor a night’s lodging, were going to rest here.’\\n\\nThere was a feeble lamp at no great distance; the only one in the\\nplace, which was a kind of square yard, but sufficient to show how poor\\nand mean it was.', 'To this, the figure beckoned them; at the same time\\ndrawing within its rays, as if to show that it had no desire to conceal\\nitself or take them at an advantage.', 'The form was that of a man,\\nmiserably clad and begrimed with smoke, which, perhaps by its contrast\\nwith the natural colour of his skin, made him look paler than he really\\nwas.', 'That he was naturally of a very wan and pallid aspect, however,\\nhis hollow cheeks, sharp features, and sunken eyes, no less than a\\ncertain look of patient endurance, sufficiently testified.', 'His voice\\nwas harsh by nature, but not brutal; and though his face, besides\\npossessing the characteristics already mentioned, was overshadowed by a\\nquantity of long dark hair, its expression was neither ferocious nor\\nbad.', '‘How came you to think of resting there?’ he said.', '‘Or how,’ he added,\\nlooking more attentively at the child, ‘do you come to want a place of\\nrest at this time of night?’\\n\\n‘Our misfortunes,’ the grandfather answered, ‘are the cause.’\\n\\n‘Do you know,’ said the man, looking still more earnestly at Nell, ‘how\\nwet she is, and that the damp streets are not a place for her?’\\n\\n‘I know it well, God help me,’ he replied.', '‘What can I do!’\\n\\nThe man looked at Nell again, and gently touched her garments, from\\nwhich the rain was running off in little streams.', '‘I can give you\\nwarmth,’ he said, after a pause; ‘nothing else.', 'Such lodging as I\\nhave, is in that house,’ pointing to the doorway from which he had\\nemerged, ‘but she is safer and better there than here.', 'The fire is in\\na rough place, but you can pass the night beside it safely, if you’ll\\ntrust yourselves to me.', 'You see that red light yonder?’\\n\\nThey raised their eyes, and saw a lurid glare hanging in the dark sky;\\nthe dull reflection of some distant fire.', '‘It’s not far,’ said the man.', '‘Shall I take you there?', 'You were going\\nto sleep upon cold bricks; I can give you a bed of warm ashes--nothing\\nbetter.’\\n\\nWithout waiting for any further reply than he saw in their looks, he\\ntook Nell in his arms, and bade the old man follow.', 'Carrying her as tenderly, and as easily too, as if she had been an\\ninfant, and showing himself both swift and sure of foot, he led the way\\nthrough what appeared to be the poorest and most wretched quarter of\\nthe town; and turning aside to avoid the overflowing kennels or running\\nwaterspouts, but holding his course, regardless of such obstructions,\\nand making his way straight through them.', 'They had proceeded thus, in\\nsilence, for some quarter of an hour, and had lost sight of the glare\\nto which he had pointed, in the dark and narrow ways by which they had\\ncome, when it suddenly burst upon them again, streaming up from the\\nhigh chimney of a building close before them.', '‘This is the place,’ he said, pausing at a door to put Nell down and\\ntake her hand.', '‘Don’t be afraid.', 'There’s nobody here will harm you.’\\n\\nIt needed a strong confidence in this assurance to induce them to\\nenter, and what they saw inside did not diminish their apprehension and\\nalarm.', 'In a large and lofty building, supported by pillars of iron,\\nwith great black apertures in the upper walls, open to the external\\nair; echoing to the roof with the beating of hammers and roar of\\nfurnaces, mingled with the hissing of red-hot metal plunged in water,\\nand a hundred strange unearthly noises never heard elsewhere; in this\\ngloomy place, moving like demons among the flame and smoke, dimly and\\nfitfully seen, flushed and tormented by the burning fires, and wielding\\ngreat weapons, a faulty blow from any one of which must have crushed\\nsome workman’s skull, a number of men laboured like giants.', 'Others,\\nreposing upon heaps of coals or ashes, with their faces turned to the\\nblack vault above, slept or rested from their toil.', 'Others again,\\nopening the white-hot furnace-doors, cast fuel on the flames, which\\ncame rushing and roaring forth to meet it, and licked it up like oil.', 'Others drew forth, with clashing noise, upon the ground, great sheets\\nof glowing steel, emitting an insupportable heat, and a dull deep light\\nlike that which reddens in the eyes of savage beasts.', 'Through these bewildering sights and deafening sounds, their conductor\\nled them to where, in a dark portion of the building, one furnace burnt\\nby night and day--so, at least, they gathered from the motion of his\\nlips, for as yet they could only see him speak: not hear him.', 'The man\\nwho had been watching this fire, and whose task was ended for the\\npresent, gladly withdrew, and left them with their friend, who,\\nspreading Nell’s little cloak upon a heap of ashes, and showing her\\nwhere she could hang her outer-clothes to dry, signed to her and the\\nold man to lie down and sleep.', 'For himself, he took his station on a\\nrugged mat before the furnace-door, and resting his chin upon his\\nhands, watched the flame as it shone through the iron chinks, and the\\nwhite ashes as they fell into their bright hot grave below.', 'The warmth of her bed, hard and humble as it was, combined with the\\ngreat fatigue she had undergone, soon caused the tumult of the place to\\nfall with a gentler sound upon the child’s tired ears, and was not long\\nin lulling her to sleep.', 'The old man was stretched beside her, and\\nwith her hand upon his neck she lay and dreamed.', 'It was yet night when she awoke, nor did she know how long, or for how\\nshort a time, she had slept.', 'But she found herself protected, both\\nfrom any cold air that might find its way into the building, and from\\nthe scorching heat, by some of the workmen’s clothes; and glancing at\\ntheir friend saw that he sat in exactly the same attitude, looking with\\na fixed earnestness of attention towards the fire, and keeping so very\\nstill that he did not even seem to breathe.', 'She lay in the state\\nbetween sleeping and waking, looking so long at his motionless figure\\nthat at length she almost feared he had died as he sat there; and\\nsoftly rising and drawing close to him, ventured to whisper in his ear.', 'He moved, and glancing from her to the place she had lately occupied,\\nas if to assure himself that it was really the child so near him,\\nlooked inquiringly into her face.', '‘I feared you were ill,’ she said.', '‘The other men are all in motion,\\nand you are so very quiet.’\\n\\n‘They leave me to myself,’ he replied.', '‘They know my humour.', 'They\\nlaugh at me, but don’t harm me in it.', 'See yonder there--that’s my\\nfriend.’\\n\\n‘The fire?’ said the child.', '‘It has been alive as long as I have,’ the man made answer.', '‘We talk\\nand think together all night long.’\\n\\nThe child glanced quickly at him in her surprise, but he had turned his\\neyes in their former direction, and was musing as before.', '‘It’s like a book to me,’ he said--‘the only book I ever learned to\\nread; and many an old story it tells me.', 'It’s music, for I should know\\nits voice among a thousand, and there are other voices in its roar.', 'It\\nhas its pictures too.', 'You don’t know how many strange faces and\\ndifferent scenes I trace in the red-hot coals.', 'It’s my memory, that\\nfire, and shows me all my life.’\\n\\nThe child, bending down to listen to his words, could not help\\nremarking with what brightened eyes he continued to speak and muse.', '‘Yes,’ he said, with a faint smile, ‘it was the same when I was quite a\\nbaby, and crawled about it, till I fell asleep.', 'My father watched it\\nthen.’\\n\\n‘Had you no mother?’ asked the child.', '‘No, she was dead.', 'Women work hard in these parts.', 'She worked herself\\nto death they told me, and, as they said so then, the fire has gone on\\nsaying the same thing ever since.', 'I suppose it was true.', 'I have\\nalways believed it.’\\n\\n‘Were you brought up here, then?’ said the child.', '‘Summer and winter,’ he replied.', '‘Secretly at first, but when they\\nfound it out, they let him keep me here.', 'So the fire nursed me--the\\nsame fire.', 'It has never gone out.’\\n\\n‘You are fond of it?’ said the child.', '‘Of course I am.', 'He died before it.', 'I saw him fall down--just there,\\nwhere those ashes are burning now--and wondered, I remember, why it\\ndidn’t help him.’\\n\\n‘Have you been here ever since?’ asked the child.', '‘Ever since I came to watch it; but there was a while between, and a\\nvery cold dreary while it was.', 'It burned all the time though, and\\nroared and leaped when I came back, as it used to do in our play days.', 'You may guess, from looking at me, what kind of child I was, but for\\nall the difference between us I was a child, and when I saw you in the\\nstreet to-night, you put me in mind of myself, as I was after he died,\\nand made me wish to bring you to the fire.', 'I thought of those old\\ntimes again, when I saw you sleeping by it.', 'You should be sleeping\\nnow.', 'Lie down again, poor child, lie down again!’\\n\\nWith that, he led her to her rude couch, and covering her with the\\nclothes with which she had found herself enveloped when she woke,\\nreturned to his seat, whence he moved no more unless to feed the\\nfurnace, but remained motionless as a statue.', 'The child continued to\\nwatch him for a little time, but soon yielded to the drowsiness that\\ncame upon her, and, in the dark strange place and on the heap of ashes,\\nslept as peacefully as if the room had been a palace chamber, and the\\nbed, a bed of down.', 'When she awoke again, broad day was shining through the lofty openings\\nin the walls, and, stealing in slanting rays but midway down, seemed to\\nmake the building darker than it had been at night.', 'The clang and\\ntumult were still going on, and the remorseless fires were burning\\nfiercely as before; for few changes of night and day brought rest or\\nquiet there.', 'Her friend parted his breakfast--a scanty mess of coffee and some\\ncoarse bread--with the child and her grandfather, and inquired whither\\nthey were going.', 'She told him that they sought some distant country\\nplace remote from towns or even other villages, and with a faltering\\ntongue inquired what road they would do best to take.', '‘I know little of the country,’ he said, shaking his head, ‘for such as\\nI, pass all our lives before our furnace doors, and seldom go forth to\\nbreathe.', 'But there are such places yonder.’\\n\\n‘And far from here?’ said Nell.', '‘Aye surely.', 'How could they be near us, and be green and fresh?', 'The\\nroad lies, too, through miles and miles, all lighted up by fires like\\nours--a strange black road, and one that would frighten you by night.’\\n\\n‘We are here and must go on,’ said the child boldly; for she saw that\\nthe old man listened with anxious ears to this account.', '‘Rough people--paths never made for little feet like yours--a dismal\\nblighted way--is there no turning back, my child?’\\n\\n‘There is none,’ cried Nell, pressing forward.', '‘If you can direct us,\\ndo.', 'If not, pray do not seek to turn us from our purpose.', 'Indeed you\\ndo not know the danger that we shun, and how right and true we are in\\nflying from it, or you would not try to stop us, I am sure you would\\nnot.’\\n\\n‘God forbid, if it is so!’ said their uncouth protector, glancing from\\nthe eager child to her grandfather, who hung his head and bent his eyes\\nupon the ground.', '‘I’ll direct you from the door, the best I can.', 'I\\nwish I could do more.’\\n\\nHe showed them, then, by which road they must leave the town, and what\\ncourse they should hold when they had gained it.', 'He lingered so long\\non these instructions, that the child, with a fervent blessing, tore\\nherself away, and stayed to hear no more.', 'But, before they had reached the corner of the lane, the man came\\nrunning after them, and, pressing her hand, left something in it--two\\nold, battered, smoke-encrusted penny pieces.', 'Who knows but they shone\\nas brightly in the eyes of angels, as golden gifts that have been\\nchronicled on tombs?', 'And thus they separated; the child to lead her sacred charge farther\\nfrom guilt and shame; the labourer to attach a fresh interest to the\\nspot where his guests had slept, and read new histories in his furnace\\nfire.', 'CHAPTER 45\\n\\nIn all their journeying, they had never longed so ardently, they had\\nnever so pined and wearied, for the freedom of pure air and open\\ncountry, as now.', 'No, not even on that memorable morning, when,\\ndeserting their old home, they abandoned themselves to the mercies of a\\nstrange world, and left all the dumb and senseless things they had\\nknown and loved, behind--not even then, had they so yearned for the\\nfresh solitudes of wood, hillside, and field, as now, when the noise\\nand dirt and vapour, of the great manufacturing town reeking with lean\\nmisery and hungry wretchedness, hemmed them in on every side, and\\nseemed to shut out hope, and render escape impossible.', '‘Two days and nights!’ thought the child.', '‘He said two days and nights\\nwe should have to spend among such scenes as these.', 'Oh!', 'if we live to\\nreach the country once again, if we get clear of these dreadful places,\\nthough it is only to lie down and die, with what a grateful heart I\\nshall thank God for so much mercy!’\\n\\nWith thoughts like this, and with some vague design of travelling to a\\ngreat distance among streams and mountains, where only very poor and\\nsimple people lived, and where they might maintain themselves by very\\nhumble helping work in farms, free from such terrors as that from which\\nthey fled--the child, with no resource but the poor man’s gift, and no\\nencouragement but that which flowed from her own heart, and its sense\\nof the truth and right of what she did, nerved herself to this last\\njourney and boldly pursued her task.', '‘We shall be very slow to-day, dear,’ she said, as they toiled\\npainfully through the streets; ‘my feet are sore, and I have pains in\\nall my limbs from the wet of yesterday.', 'I saw that he looked at us and\\nthought of that, when he said how long we should be upon the road.’\\n\\n‘It was a dreary way he told us of,’ returned her grandfather,\\npiteously.', '‘Is there no other road?', 'Will you not let me go some other\\nway than this?’\\n\\n‘Places lie beyond these,’ said the child, firmly, ‘where we may live\\nin peace, and be tempted to do no harm.', 'We will take the road that\\npromises to have that end, and we would not turn out of it, if it were\\na hundred times worse than our fears lead us to expect.', 'We would not,\\ndear, would we?’\\n\\n‘No,’ replied the old man, wavering in his voice, no less than in his\\nmanner.', '‘No.', 'Let us go on.', 'I am ready.', 'I am quite ready, Nell.’\\n\\nThe child walked with more difficulty than she had led her companion to\\nexpect, for the pains that racked her joints were of no common\\nseverity, and every exertion increased them.', 'But they wrung from her\\nno complaint, or look of suffering; and, though the two travellers\\nproceeded very slowly, they did proceed.', 'Clearing the town in course\\nof time, they began to feel that they were fairly on their way.', 'A long suburb of red brick houses--some with patches of garden-ground,\\nwhere coal-dust and factory smoke darkened the shrinking leaves, and\\ncoarse rank flowers, and where the struggling vegetation sickened and\\nsank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace, making them by its\\npresence seem yet more blighting and unwholesome than in the town\\nitself--a long, flat, straggling suburb passed, they came, by slow\\ndegrees, upon a cheerless region, where not a blade of grass was seen\\nto grow, where not a bud put forth its promise in the spring, where\\nnothing green could live but on the surface of the stagnant pools,\\nwhich here and there lay idly sweltering by the black road-side.', 'Advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place, its\\ndark depressing influence stole upon their spirits, and filled them\\nwith a dismal gloom.', 'On every side, and far as the eye could see into\\nthe heavy distance, tall chimneys, crowding on each other, and\\npresenting that endless repetition of the same dull, ugly form, which\\nis the horror of oppressive dreams, poured out their plague of smoke,\\nobscured the light, and made foul the melancholy air.', 'On mounds of\\nashes by the wayside, sheltered only by a few rough boards, or rotten\\npent-house roofs, strange engines spun and writhed like tortured\\ncreatures; clanking their iron chains, shrieking in their rapid whirl\\nfrom time to time as though in torment unendurable, and making the\\nground tremble with their agonies.', 'Dismantled houses here and there\\nappeared, tottering to the earth, propped up by fragments of others\\nthat had fallen down, unroofed, windowless, blackened, desolate, but\\nyet inhabited.', 'Men, women, children, wan in their looks and ragged in\\nattire, tended the engines, fed their tributary fire, begged upon the\\nroad, or scowled half-naked from the doorless houses.', 'Then came more\\nof the wrathful monsters, whose like they almost seemed to be in their\\nwildness and their untamed air, screeching and turning round and round\\nagain; and still, before, behind, and to the right and left, was the\\nsame interminable perspective of brick towers, never ceasing in their\\nblack vomit, blasting all things living or inanimate, shutting out the\\nface of day, and closing in on all these horrors with a dense dark\\ncloud.', 'But night-time in this dreadful spot!--night, when the smoke was\\nchanged to fire; when every chimney spirited up its flame; and places,\\nthat had been dark vaults all day, now shone red-hot, with figures\\nmoving to and fro within their blazing jaws, and calling to one another\\nwith hoarse cries--night, when the noise of every strange machine was\\naggravated by the darkness; when the people near them looked wilder and\\nmore savage; when bands of unemployed labourers paraded the roads, or\\nclustered by torch-light round their leaders, who told them, in stern\\nlanguage, of their wrongs, and urged them on to frightful cries and\\nthreats; when maddened men, armed with sword and firebrand, spurning\\nthe tears and prayers of women who would restrain them, rushed forth on\\nerrands of terror and destruction, to work no ruin half so surely as\\ntheir own--night, when carts came rumbling by, filled with rude\\ncoffins (for contagious disease and death had been busy with the living\\ncrops); when orphans cried, and distracted women shrieked and followed\\nin their wake--night, when some called for bread, and some for drink to\\ndrown their cares, and some with tears, and some with staggering feet,\\nand some with bloodshot eyes, went brooding home--night, which, unlike\\nthe night that Heaven sends on earth, brought with it no peace, nor\\nquiet, nor signs of blessed sleep--who shall tell the terrors of the\\nnight to the young wandering child!', 'And yet she lay down, with nothing between her and the sky; and, with\\nno fear for herself, for she was past it now, put up a prayer for the\\npoor old man.', 'So very weak and spent, she felt, so very calm and\\nunresisting, that she had no thought of any wants of her own, but\\nprayed that God would raise up some friend for him.', 'She tried to\\nrecall the way they had come, and to look in the direction where the\\nfire by which they had slept last night was burning.', 'She had forgotten\\nto ask the name of the poor man, their friend, and when she had\\nremembered him in her prayers, it seemed ungrateful not to turn one\\nlook towards the spot where he was watching.', 'A penny loaf was all they had had that day.', 'It was very little, but\\neven hunger was forgotten in the strange tranquillity that crept over\\nher senses.', 'She lay down, very gently, and, with a quiet smile upon\\nher face, fell into a slumber.', 'It was not like sleep--and yet it must\\nhave been, or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night\\nlong!', 'Morning came.', 'Much weaker, diminished powers even of sight and\\nhearing, and yet the child made no complaint--perhaps would have made\\nnone, even if she had not had that inducement to be silent, travelling\\nby her side.', 'She felt a hopelessness of their ever being extricated\\ntogether from that forlorn place; a dull conviction that she was very\\nill, perhaps dying; but no fear or anxiety.', 'A loathing of food that she was not conscious of until they expended\\ntheir last penny in the purchase of another loaf, prevented her\\npartaking even of this poor repast.', 'Her grandfather ate greedily,\\nwhich she was glad to see.', 'Their way lay through the same scenes as yesterday, with no variety or\\nimprovement.', 'There was the same thick air, difficult to breathe; the\\nsame blighted ground, the same hopeless prospect, the same misery and\\ndistress.', 'Objects appeared more dim, the noise less, the path more\\nrugged and uneven, for sometimes she stumbled, and became roused, as it\\nwere, in the effort to prevent herself from falling.', 'Poor child!', 'the\\ncause was in her tottering feet.', 'Towards the afternoon, her grandfather complained bitterly of hunger.', 'She approached one of the wretched hovels by the way-side, and knocked\\nwith her hand upon the door.', '‘What would you have here?’ said a gaunt man, opening it.', '‘Charity.', 'A morsel of bread.’\\n\\n‘Do you see that?’ returned the man hoarsely, pointing to a kind of\\nbundle on the ground.', '‘That’s a dead child.', 'I and five hundred other\\nmen were thrown out of work, three months ago.', 'That is my third dead\\nchild, and last.', 'Do you think I have charity to bestow, or a morsel of\\nbread to spare?’\\n\\nThe child recoiled from the door, and it closed upon her.', 'Impelled by\\nstrong necessity, she knocked at another: a neighbouring one, which,\\nyielding to the slight pressure of her hand, flew open.', 'It seemed that a couple of poor families lived in this hovel, for two\\nwomen, each among children of her own, occupied different portions of\\nthe room.', 'In the centre, stood a grave gentleman in black who appeared\\nto have just entered, and who held by the arm a boy.', '‘Here, woman,’ he said, ‘here’s your deaf and dumb son.', 'You may thank\\nme for restoring him to you.', 'He was brought before me, this morning,\\ncharged with theft; and with any other boy it would have gone hard, I\\nassure you.', 'But, as I had compassion on his infirmities, and thought\\nhe might have learnt no better, I have managed to bring him back to\\nyou.', 'Take more care of him for the future.’\\n\\n‘And won’t you give me back MY son!’ said the other woman, hastily\\nrising and confronting him.', '‘Won’t you give me back MY son, Sir, who\\nwas transported for the same offence!’\\n\\n‘Was he deaf and dumb, woman?’ asked the gentleman sternly.', '‘Was he not, Sir?’\\n\\n‘You know he was not.’\\n\\n‘He was,’ cried the woman.', '‘He was deaf, dumb, and blind, to all that\\nwas good and right, from his cradle.', 'Her boy may have learnt no\\nbetter!', 'where did mine learn better?', 'where could he?', 'who was there to\\nteach him better, or where was it to be learnt?’\\n\\n‘Peace, woman,’ said the gentleman, ‘your boy was in possession of all\\nhis senses.’\\n\\n‘He was,’ cried the mother; ‘and he was the more easy to be led astray\\nbecause he had them.', 'If you save this boy because he may not know\\nright from wrong, why did you not save mine who was never taught the\\ndifference?', 'You gentlemen have as good a right to punish her boy, that\\nGod has kept in ignorance of sound and speech, as you have to punish\\nmine, that you kept in ignorance yourselves.', 'How many of the girls and\\nboys--ah, men and women too--that are brought before you and you don’t\\npity, are deaf and dumb in their minds, and go wrong in that state, and\\nare punished in that state, body and soul, while you gentlemen are\\nquarrelling among yourselves whether they ought to learn this or\\nthat?--Be a just man, Sir, and give me back my son.’\\n\\n‘You are desperate,’ said the gentleman, taking out his snuff-box, ‘and\\nI am sorry for you.’\\n\\n‘I AM desperate,’ returned the woman, ‘and you have made me so.', 'Give\\nme back my son, to work for these helpless children.', 'Be a just man,\\nSir, and, as you have had mercy upon this boy, give me back my son!’\\n\\nThe child had seen and heard enough to know that this was not a place\\nat which to ask for alms.', 'She led the old man softly from the door,\\nand they pursued their journey.', 'With less and less of hope or strength, as they went on, but with an\\nundiminished resolution not to betray by any word or sigh her sinking\\nstate, so long as she had energy to move, the child, throughout the\\nremainder of that hard day, compelled herself to proceed: not even\\nstopping to rest as frequently as usual, to compensate in some measure\\nfor the tardy pace at which she was obliged to walk.', 'Evening was\\ndrawing on, but had not closed in, when--still travelling among the\\nsame dismal objects--they came to a busy town.', 'Faint and spiritless as they were, its streets were insupportable.', 'After humbly asking for relief at some few doors, and being repulsed,\\nthey agreed to make their way out of it as speedily as they could, and\\ntry if the inmates of any lone house beyond, would have more pity on\\ntheir exhausted state.', 'They were dragging themselves along through the last street, and the\\nchild felt that the time was close at hand when her enfeebled powers\\nwould bear no more.', 'There appeared before them, at this juncture,\\ngoing in the same direction as themselves, a traveller on foot, who,\\nwith a portmanteau strapped to his back, leaned upon a stout stick as\\nhe walked, and read from a book which he held in his other hand.', 'It was not an easy matter to come up with him, and beseech his aid, for\\nhe walked fast, and was a little distance in advance.', 'At length, he\\nstopped, to look more attentively at some passage in his book.', 'Animated with a ray of hope, the child shot on before her grandfather,\\nand, going close to the stranger without rousing him by the sound of\\nher footsteps, began, in a few faint words, to implore his help.', 'He turned his head.', 'The child clapped her hands together, uttered a\\nwild shriek, and fell senseless at his feet.', 'CHAPTER 46\\n\\nIt was the poor schoolmaster.', 'No other than the poor schoolmaster.', 'Scarcely less moved and surprised by the sight of the child than she\\nhad been on recognising him, he stood, for a moment, silent and\\nconfounded by this unexpected apparition, without even the presence of\\nmind to raise her from the ground.', 'But, quickly recovering his self-possession, he threw down his stick\\nand book, and dropping on one knee beside her, endeavoured, by such\\nsimple means as occurred to him, to restore her to herself; while her\\ngrandfather, standing idly by, wrung his hands, and implored her with\\nmany endearing expressions to speak to him, were it only a word.', '‘She is quite exhausted,’ said the schoolmaster, glancing upward into\\nhis face.', '‘You have taxed her powers too far, friend.’\\n\\n‘She is perishing of want,’ rejoined the old man.', '‘I never thought how\\nweak and ill she was, till now.’\\n\\nCasting a look upon him, half-reproachful and half-compassionate, the\\nschoolmaster took the child in his arms, and, bidding the old man\\ngather up her little basket and follow him directly, bore her away at\\nhis utmost speed.', 'There was a small inn within sight, to which, it would seem, he had\\nbeen directing his steps when so unexpectedly overtaken.', 'Towards this\\nplace he hurried with his unconscious burden, and rushing into the\\nkitchen, and calling upon the company there assembled to make way for\\nGod’s sake, deposited it on a chair before the fire.', 'The company, who rose in confusion on the schoolmaster’s entrance, did\\nas people usually do under such circumstances.', 'Everybody called for\\nhis or her favourite remedy, which nobody brought; each cried for more\\nair, at the same time carefully excluding what air there was, by\\nclosing round the object of sympathy; and all wondered why somebody\\nelse didn’t do what it never appeared to occur to them might be done by\\nthemselves.', 'The landlady, however, who possessed more readiness and activity than\\nany of them, and who had withal a quicker perception of the merits of\\nthe case, soon came running in, with a little hot brandy and water,\\nfollowed by her servant-girl, carrying vinegar, hartshorn,\\nsmelling-salts, and such other restoratives; which, being duly\\nadministered, recovered the child so far as to enable her to thank them\\nin a faint voice, and to extend her hand to the poor schoolmaster, who\\nstood, with an anxious face, hard by.', 'Without suffering her to speak\\nanother word, or so much as to stir a finger any more, the women\\nstraightway carried her off to bed; and, having covered her up warm,\\nbathed her cold feet, and wrapped them in flannel, they despatched a\\nmessenger for the doctor.', 'The doctor, who was a red-nosed gentleman with a great bunch of seals\\ndangling below a waistcoat of ribbed black satin, arrived with all\\nspeed, and taking his seat by the bedside of poor Nell, drew out his\\nwatch, and felt her pulse.', 'Then he looked at her tongue, then he felt\\nher pulse again, and while he did so, he eyed the half-emptied\\nwine-glass as if in profound abstraction.', '‘I should give her,’ said the doctor at length, ‘a tea-spoonful, every\\nnow and then, of hot brandy and water.’\\n\\n‘Why, that’s exactly what we’ve done, sir!’ said the delighted landlady.', '‘I should also,’ observed the doctor, who had passed the foot-bath on\\nthe stairs, ‘I should also,’ said the doctor, in the voice of an\\noracle, ‘put her feet in hot water, and wrap them up in flannel.', 'I\\nshould likewise,’ said the doctor with increased solemnity, ‘give her\\nsomething light for supper--the wing of a roasted fowl now--’\\n\\n‘Why, goodness gracious me, sir, it’s cooking at the kitchen fire this\\ninstant!’ cried the landlady.', 'And so indeed it was, for the\\nschoolmaster had ordered it to be put down, and it was getting on so\\nwell that the doctor might have smelt it if he had tried; perhaps he\\ndid.', '‘You may then,’ said the doctor, rising gravely, ‘give her a glass of\\nhot mulled port wine, if she likes wine--’\\n\\n‘And a toast, Sir?’ suggested the landlady.', '‘Ay,’ said the doctor, in the tone of a man who makes a dignified\\nconcession.', '‘And a toast--of bread.', 'But be very particular to make it\\nof bread, if you please, ma’am.’\\n\\nWith which parting injunction, slowly and portentously delivered, the\\ndoctor departed, leaving the whole house in admiration of that wisdom\\nwhich tallied so closely with their own.', 'Everybody said he was a very\\nshrewd doctor indeed, and knew perfectly what people’s constitutions\\nwere; which there appears some reason to suppose he did.', 'While her supper was preparing, the child fell into a refreshing sleep,\\nfrom which they were obliged to rouse her when it was ready.', 'As she\\nevinced extraordinary uneasiness on learning that her grandfather was\\nbelow stairs, and as she was greatly troubled at the thought of their\\nbeing apart, he took his supper with her.', 'Finding her still very\\nrestless on this head, they made him up a bed in an inner room, to\\nwhich he presently retired.', 'The key of this chamber happened by good\\nfortune to be on that side of the door which was in Nell’s room; she\\nturned it on him when the landlady had withdrawn, and crept to bed\\nagain with a thankful heart.', 'The schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen\\nfire, which was now deserted, thinking, with a very happy face, on the\\nfortunate chance which had brought him so opportunely to the child’s\\nassistance, and parrying, as well as in his simple way he could, the\\ninquisitive cross-examination of the landlady, who had a great\\ncuriosity to be made acquainted with every particular of Nell’s life\\nand history.', 'The poor schoolmaster was so open-hearted, and so little\\nversed in the most ordinary cunning or deceit, that she could not have\\nfailed to succeed in the first five minutes, but that he happened to be\\nunacquainted with what she wished to know; and so he told her.', 'The\\nlandlady, by no means satisfied with this assurance, which she\\nconsidered an ingenious evasion of the question, rejoined that he had\\nhis reasons of course.', 'Heaven forbid that she should wish to pry into\\nthe affairs of her customers, which indeed were no business of hers,\\nwho had so many of her own.', 'She had merely asked a civil question, and\\nto be sure she knew it would meet with a civil answer.', 'She was quite\\nsatisfied--quite.', 'She had rather perhaps that he would have said at\\nonce that he didn’t choose to be communicative, because that would have\\nbeen plain and intelligible.', 'However, she had no right to be offended\\nof course.', 'He was the best judge, and had a perfect right to say what\\nhe pleased; nobody could dispute that for a moment.', 'Oh dear, no!', '‘I assure you, my good lady,’ said the mild schoolmaster, ‘that I have\\ntold you the plain truth.', 'As I hope to be saved, I have told you the\\ntruth.’\\n\\n‘Why then, I do believe you are in earnest,’ rejoined the landlady,\\nwith ready good-humour, ‘and I’m very sorry I have teazed you.', 'But\\ncuriosity you know is the curse of our sex, and that’s the fact.’\\n\\nThe landlord scratched his head, as if he thought the curse sometimes\\ninvolved the other sex likewise; but he was prevented from making any\\nremark to that effect, if he had it in contemplation to do so, by the\\nschoolmaster’s rejoinder.', '‘You should question me for half-a-dozen hours at a sitting, and\\nwelcome, and I would answer you patiently for the kindness of heart you\\nhave shown to-night, if I could,’ he said.', '‘As it is, please to take\\ncare of her in the morning, and let me know early how she is; and to\\nunderstand that I am paymaster for the three.’\\n\\nSo, parting with them on most friendly terms (not the less cordial\\nperhaps for this last direction), the schoolmaster went to his bed, and\\nthe host and hostess to theirs.', 'The report in the morning was, that the child was better, but was\\nextremely weak, and would at least require a day’s rest, and careful\\nnursing, before she could proceed upon her journey.', 'The schoolmaster\\nreceived this communication with perfect cheerfulness, observing that\\nhe had a day to spare--two days for that matter--and could very well\\nafford to wait.', 'As the patient was to sit up in the evening, he\\nappointed to visit her in her room at a certain hour, and rambling out\\nwith his book, did not return until the hour arrived.', 'Nell could not help weeping when they were left alone; whereat, and at\\nsight of her pale face and wasted figure, the simple schoolmaster shed\\na few tears himself, at the same time showing in very energetic\\nlanguage how foolish it was to do so, and how very easily it could be\\navoided, if one tried.', '‘It makes me unhappy even in the midst of all this kindness’ said the\\nchild, ‘to think that we should be a burden upon you.', 'How can I ever\\nthank you?', 'If I had not met you so far from home, I must have died,\\nand he would have been left alone.’\\n\\n‘We’ll not talk about dying,’ said the schoolmaster; ‘and as to\\nburdens, I have made my fortune since you slept at my cottage.’\\n\\n‘Indeed!’ cried the child joyfully.', '‘Oh yes,’ returned her friend.', '‘I have been appointed clerk and\\nschoolmaster to a village a long way from here--and a long way from the\\nold one as you may suppose--at five-and-thirty pounds a year.', 'Five-and-thirty pounds!’\\n\\n‘I am very glad,’ said the child, ‘so very, very glad.’\\n\\n‘I am on my way there now,’ resumed the schoolmaster.', '‘They allowed me\\nthe stage-coach-hire--outside stage-coach-hire all the way.', 'Bless you,\\nthey grudge me nothing.', 'But as the time at which I am expected there,\\nleft me ample leisure, I determined to walk instead.', 'How glad I am, to\\nthink I did so!’\\n\\n‘How glad should we be!’\\n\\n‘Yes, yes,’ said the schoolmaster, moving restlessly in his chair,\\n‘certainly, that’s very true.', 'But you--where are you going, where are\\nyou coming from, what have you been doing since you left me, what had\\nyou been doing before?', 'Now, tell me--do tell me.', 'I know very little\\nof the world, and perhaps you are better fitted to advise me in its\\naffairs than I am qualified to give advice to you; but I am very\\nsincere, and I have a reason (you have not forgotten it) for loving\\nyou.', 'I have felt since that time as if my love for him who died, had\\nbeen transferred to you who stood beside his bed.', 'If this,’ he added,\\nlooking upwards, ‘is the beautiful creation that springs from ashes,\\nlet its peace prosper with me, as I deal tenderly and compassionately\\nby this young child!’\\n\\nThe plain, frank kindness of the honest schoolmaster, the affectionate\\nearnestness of his speech and manner, the truth which was stamped upon\\nhis every word and look, gave the child a confidence in him, which the\\nutmost arts of treachery and dissimulation could never have awakened in\\nher breast.', 'She told him all--that they had no friend or\\nrelative--that she had fled with the old man, to save him from a\\nmadhouse and all the miseries he dreaded--that she was flying now, to\\nsave him from himself--and that she sought an asylum in some remote\\nand primitive place, where the temptation before which he fell would\\nnever enter, and her late sorrows and distresses could have no place.', 'The schoolmaster heard her with astonishment.', '‘This child!’--he\\nthought--‘Has this child heroically persevered under all doubts and\\ndangers, struggled with poverty and suffering, upheld and sustained by\\nstrong affection and the consciousness of rectitude alone!', 'And yet the\\nworld is full of such heroism.', 'Have I yet to learn that the hardest\\nand best-borne trials are those which are never chronicled in any\\nearthly record, and are suffered every day!', 'And should I be surprised\\nto hear the story of this child!’\\n\\nWhat more he thought or said, matters not.', 'It was concluded that Nell\\nand her grandfather should accompany him to the village whither he was\\nbound, and that he should endeavour to find them some humble occupation\\nby which they could subsist.', '‘We shall be sure to succeed,’ said the\\nschoolmaster, heartily.', '‘The cause is too good a one to fail.’\\n\\nThey arranged to proceed upon their journey next evening, as a\\nstage-waggon, which travelled for some distance on the same road as\\nthey must take, would stop at the inn to change horses, and the driver\\nfor a small gratuity would give Nell a place inside.', 'A bargain was\\nsoon struck when the waggon came; and in due time it rolled away; with\\nthe child comfortably bestowed among the softer packages, her\\ngrandfather and the schoolmaster walking on beside the driver, and the\\nlandlady and all the good folks of the inn screaming out their good\\nwishes and farewells.', 'What a soothing, luxurious, drowsy way of travelling, to lie inside\\nthat slowly-moving mountain, listening to the tinkling of the horses’\\nbells, the occasional smacking of the carter’s whip, the smooth rolling\\nof the great broad wheels, the rattle of the harness, the cheery\\ngood-nights of passing travellers jogging past on little short-stepped\\nhorses--all made pleasantly indistinct by the thick awning, which\\nseemed made for lazy listening under, till one fell asleep!', 'The very\\ngoing to sleep, still with an indistinct idea, as the head jogged to\\nand fro upon the pillow, of moving onward with no trouble or fatigue,\\nand hearing all these sounds like dreamy music, lulling to the\\nsenses--and the slow waking up, and finding one’s self staring out\\nthrough the breezy curtain half-opened in the front, far up into the\\ncold bright sky with its countless stars, and downward at the driver’s\\nlantern dancing on like its namesake Jack of the swamps and marshes,\\nand sideways at the dark grim trees, and forward at the long bare road\\nrising up, up, up, until it stopped abruptly at a sharp high ridge as\\nif there were no more road, and all beyond was sky--and the stopping at\\nthe inn to bait, and being helped out, and going into a room with fire\\nand candles, and winking very much, and being agreeably reminded that\\nthe night was cold, and anxious for very comfort’s sake to think it\\ncolder than it was!--What a delicious journey was that journey in the\\nwaggon.', 'Then the going on again--so fresh at first, and shortly afterwards so\\nsleepy.', 'The waking from a sound nap as the mail came dashing past like\\na highway comet, with gleaming lamps and rattling hoofs, and visions of\\na guard behind, standing up to keep his feet warm, and of a gentleman\\nin a fur cap opening his eyes and looking wild and stupefied--the\\nstopping at the turnpike where the man was gone to bed, and knocking at\\nthe door until he answered with a smothered shout from under the\\nbed-clothes in the little room above, where the faint light was\\nburning, and presently came down, night-capped and shivering, to throw\\nthe gate wide open, and wish all waggons off the road except by day.', 'The cold sharp interval between night and morning--the distant streak\\nof light widening and spreading, and turning from grey to white, and\\nfrom white to yellow, and from yellow to burning red--the presence of\\nday, with all its cheerfulness and life--men and horses at the\\nplough--birds in the trees and hedges, and boys in solitary fields,\\nfrightening them away with rattles.', 'The coming to a town--people busy\\nin the markets; light carts and chaises round the tavern yard;\\ntradesmen standing at their doors; men running horses up and down the\\nstreet for sale; pigs plunging and grunting in the dirty distance,\\ngetting off with long strings at their legs, running into clean\\nchemists’ shops and being dislodged with brooms by ‘prentices; the\\nnight coach changing horses--the passengers cheerless, cold, ugly, and\\ndiscontented, with three months’ growth of hair in one night--the\\ncoachman fresh as from a band-box, and exquisitely beautiful by\\ncontrast:--so much bustle, so many things in motion, such a variety of\\nincidents--when was there a journey with so many delights as that\\njourney in the waggon!', 'Sometimes walking for a mile or two while her grandfather rode inside,\\nand sometimes even prevailing upon the schoolmaster to take her place\\nand lie down to rest, Nell travelled on very happily until they came to\\na large town, where the waggon stopped, and where they spent a night.', 'They passed a large church; and in the streets were a number of old\\nhouses, built of a kind of earth or plaster, crossed and re-crossed in\\na great many directions with black beams, which gave them a remarkable\\nand very ancient look.', 'The doors, too, were arched and low, some with\\noaken portals and quaint benches, where the former inhabitants had sat\\non summer evenings.', 'The windows were latticed in little diamond panes,\\nthat seemed to wink and blink upon the passengers as if they were dim\\nof sight.', 'They had long since got clear of the smoke and furnaces,\\nexcept in one or two solitary instances, where a factory planted among\\nfields withered the space about it, like a burning mountain.', 'When they\\nhad passed through this town, they entered again upon the country, and\\nbegan to draw near their place of destination.', 'It was not so near, however, but that they spent another night upon the\\nroad; not that their doing so was quite an act of necessity, but that\\nthe schoolmaster, when they approached within a few miles of his\\nvillage, had a fidgety sense of his dignity as the new clerk, and was\\nunwilling to make his entry in dusty shoes, and travel-disordered\\ndress.', 'It was a fine, clear, autumn morning, when they came upon the\\nscene of his promotion, and stopped to contemplate its beauties.', '‘See--here’s the church!’ cried the delighted schoolmaster in a low\\nvoice; ‘and that old building close beside it, is the schoolhouse, I’ll\\nbe sworn.', 'Five-and-thirty pounds a-year in this beautiful place!’\\n\\nThey admired everything--the old grey porch, the mullioned windows, the\\nvenerable gravestones dotting the green churchyard, the ancient tower,\\nthe very weathercock; the brown thatched roofs of cottage, barn, and\\nhomestead, peeping from among the trees; the stream that rippled by the\\ndistant water-mill; the blue Welsh mountains far away.', 'It was for such\\na spot the child had wearied in the dense, dark, miserable haunts of\\nlabour.', 'Upon her bed of ashes, and amidst the squalid horrors through\\nwhich they had forced their way, visions of such scenes--beautiful\\nindeed, but not more beautiful than this sweet reality--had been always\\npresent to her mind.', 'They had seemed to melt into a dim and airy\\ndistance, as the prospect of ever beholding them again grew fainter;\\nbut, as they receded, she had loved and panted for them more.', '‘I must leave you somewhere for a few minutes,’ said the schoolmaster,\\nat length breaking the silence into which they had fallen in their\\ngladness.', '‘I have a letter to present, and inquiries to make, you\\nknow.', 'Where shall I take you?', 'To the little inn yonder?’\\n\\n‘Let us wait here,’ rejoined Nell.', '‘The gate is open.', 'We will sit in\\nthe church porch till you come back.’\\n\\n‘A good place too,’ said the schoolmaster, leading the way towards it,\\ndisencumbering himself of his portmanteau, and placing it on the stone\\nseat.', '‘Be sure that I come back with good news, and am not long gone!’\\n\\nSo, the happy schoolmaster put on a bran-new pair of gloves which he\\nhad carried in a little parcel in his pocket all the way, and hurried\\noff, full of ardour and excitement.', 'The child watched him from the porch until the intervening foliage hid\\nhim from her view, and then stepped softly out into the old\\nchurchyard--so solemn and quiet that every rustle of her dress upon the\\nfallen leaves, which strewed the path and made her footsteps noiseless,\\nseemed an invasion of its silence.', 'It was a very aged, ghostly place;\\nthe church had been built many hundreds of years ago, and had once had\\na convent or monastery attached; for arches in ruins, remains of oriel\\nwindows, and fragments of blackened walls, were yet standing; while\\nother portions of the old building, which had crumbled away and fallen\\ndown, were mingled with the churchyard earth and overgrown with grass,\\nas if they too claimed a burying-place and sought to mix their ashes\\nwith the dust of men.', 'Hard by these gravestones of dead years, and\\nforming a part of the ruin which some pains had been taken to render\\nhabitable in modern times, were two small dwellings with sunken windows\\nand oaken doors, fast hastening to decay, empty and desolate.', 'Upon these tenements, the attention of the child became exclusively\\nriveted.', 'She knew not why.', 'The church, the ruin, the antiquated\\ngraves, had equal claims at least upon a stranger’s thoughts, but from\\nthe moment when her eyes first rested on these two dwellings, she could\\nturn to nothing else.', 'Even when she had made the circuit of the\\nenclosure, and, returning to the porch, sat pensively waiting for their\\nfriend, she took her station where she could still look upon them, and\\nfelt as if fascinated towards that spot.', 'CHAPTER 47\\n\\nKit’s mother and the single gentleman--upon whose track it is expedient\\nto follow with hurried steps, lest this history should be chargeable\\nwith inconstancy, and the offence of leaving its characters in\\nsituations of uncertainty and doubt--Kit’s mother and the single\\ngentleman, speeding onward in the post-chaise-and-four whose departure\\nfrom the Notary’s door we have already witnessed, soon left the town\\nbehind them, and struck fire from the flints of the broad highway.', 'The good woman, being not a little embarrassed by the novelty of her\\nsituation, and certain material apprehensions that perhaps by this time\\nlittle Jacob, or the baby, or both, had fallen into the fire, or\\ntumbled down stairs, or had been squeezed behind doors, or had scalded\\ntheir windpipes in endeavouring to allay their thirst at the spouts of\\ntea-kettles, preserved an uneasy silence; and meeting from the window\\nthe eyes of turnpike-men, omnibus-drivers, and others, felt in the new\\ndignity of her position like a mourner at a funeral, who, not being\\ngreatly afflicted by the loss of the departed, recognizes his every-day\\nacquaintance from the window of the mourning coach, but is constrained\\nto preserve a decent solemnity, and the appearance of being indifferent\\nto all external objects.', 'To have been indifferent to the companionship of the single gentleman\\nwould have been tantamount to being gifted with nerves of steel.', 'Never\\ndid chaise inclose, or horses draw, such a restless gentleman as he.', 'He never sat in the same position for two minutes together, but was\\nperpetually tossing his arms and legs about, pulling up the sashes and\\nletting them violently down, or thrusting his head out of one window to\\ndraw it in again and thrust it out of another.', 'He carried in his\\npocket, too, a fire-box of mysterious and unknown construction; and as\\nsure as ever Kit’s mother closed her eyes, so surely--whisk, rattle,\\nfizz--there was the single gentleman consulting his watch by a flame of\\nfire, and letting the sparks fall down among the straw as if there were\\nno such thing as a possibility of himself and Kit’s mother being\\nroasted alive before the boys could stop their horses.', 'Whenever they\\nhalted to change, there he was--out of the carriage without letting\\ndown the steps, bursting about the inn-yard like a lighted cracker,\\npulling out his watch by lamp-light and forgetting to look at it before\\nhe put it up again, and in short committing so many extravagances that\\nKit’s mother was quite afraid of him.', 'Then, when the horses were to,\\nin he came like a Harlequin, and before they had gone a mile, out came\\nthe watch and the fire-box together, and Kit’s mother as wide awake\\nagain, with no hope of a wink of sleep for that stage.', '‘Are you comfortable?’ the single gentleman would say after one of\\nthese exploits, turning sharply round.', '‘Quite, Sir, thank you.’\\n\\n‘Are you sure?', 'An’t you cold?’\\n\\n‘It is a little chilly, Sir,’ Kit’s mother would reply.', '‘I knew it!’ cried the single gentleman, letting down one of the front\\nglasses.', '‘She wants some brandy and water!', 'Of course she does.', 'How\\ncould I forget it?', 'Hallo!', 'Stop at the next inn, and call out for a\\nglass of hot brandy and water.’\\n\\nIt was in vain for Kit’s mother to protest that she stood in need of\\nnothing of the kind.', 'The single gentleman was inexorable; and whenever\\nhe had exhausted all other modes and fashions of restlessness, it\\ninvariably occurred to him that Kit’s mother wanted brandy and water.', 'In this way they travelled on until near midnight, when they stopped to\\nsupper, for which meal the single gentleman ordered everything eatable\\nthat the house contained; and because Kit’s mother didn’t eat\\neverything at once, and eat it all, he took it into his head that she\\nmust be ill.\\n\\n‘You’re faint,’ said the single gentleman, who did nothing himself but\\nwalk about the room.', '‘I see what’s the matter with you, ma’am.', 'You’re\\nfaint.’\\n\\n‘Thank you, sir, I’m not indeed.’\\n\\n‘I know you are.', 'I’m sure of it.', 'I drag this poor woman from the\\nbosom of her family at a minute’s notice, and she goes on getting\\nfainter and fainter before my eyes.', 'I’m a pretty fellow!', 'How many\\nchildren have you got, ma’am?’\\n\\n‘Two, sir, besides Kit.’\\n\\n‘Boys, ma’am?’\\n\\n‘Yes, sir.’\\n\\n‘Are they christened?’\\n\\n‘Only half baptised as yet, sir.’\\n\\n‘I’m godfather to both of ‘em.', 'Remember that, if you please, ma’am.', 'You had better have some mulled wine.’\\n\\n‘I couldn’t touch a drop indeed, sir.’\\n\\n‘You must,’ said the single gentleman.', '‘I see you want it.', 'I ought to\\nhave thought of it before.’\\n\\nImmediately flying to the bell, and calling for mulled wine as\\nimpetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of\\nsome person apparently drowned, the single gentleman made Kit’s mother\\nswallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the tears ran\\ndown her face, and then hustled her off to the chaise again, where--not\\nimpossibly from the effects of this agreeable sedative--she soon became\\ninsensible to his restlessness, and fell fast asleep.', 'Nor were the\\nhappy effects of this prescription of a transitory nature, as,\\nnotwithstanding that the distance was greater, and the journey longer,\\nthan the single gentleman had anticipated, she did not awake until it\\nwas broad day, and they were clattering over the pavement of a town.', '‘This is the place!’ cried her companion, letting down all the glasses.', '‘Drive to the wax-work!’\\n\\nThe boy on the wheeler touched his hat, and setting spurs to his horse,\\nto the end that they might go in brilliantly, all four broke into a\\nsmart canter, and dashed through the streets with a noise that brought\\nthe good folks wondering to their doors and windows, and drowned the\\nsober voices of the town-clocks as they chimed out half-past eight.', 'They drove up to a door round which a crowd of persons were collected,\\nand there stopped.', '‘What’s this?’ said the single gentleman thrusting out his head.', '‘Is\\nanything the matter here?’\\n\\n‘A wedding Sir, a wedding!’ cried several voices.', '‘Hurrah!’\\n\\nThe single gentleman, rather bewildered by finding himself the centre\\nof this noisy throng, alighted with the assistance of one of the\\npostilions, and handed out Kit’s mother, at sight of whom the populace\\ncried out, ‘Here’s another wedding!’ and roared and leaped for joy.', '‘The world has gone mad, I think,’ said the single gentleman, pressing\\nthrough the concourse with his supposed bride.', '‘Stand back here, will\\nyou, and let me knock.’\\n\\nAnything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd.', 'A score of\\ndirty hands were raised directly to knock for him, and seldom has a\\nknocker of equal powers been made to produce more deafening sounds than\\nthis particular engine on the occasion in question.', 'Having rendered\\nthese voluntary services, the throng modestly retired a little,\\npreferring that the single gentleman should bear their consequences\\nalone.', '‘Now, sir, what do you want!’ said a man with a large white bow at his\\nbutton-hole, opening the door, and confronting him with a very stoical\\naspect.', '‘Who has been married here, my friend?’ said the single gentleman.', '‘I have.’\\n\\n‘You!', 'and to whom in the devil’s name?’\\n\\n‘What right have you to ask?’ returned the bridegroom, eyeing him from\\ntop to toe.', '‘What right!’ cried the single gentleman, drawing the arm of Kit’s\\nmother more tightly through his own, for that good woman evidently had\\nit in contemplation to run away.', '‘A right you little dream of.', 'Mind,\\ngood people, if this fellow has been marrying a minor--tut, tut, that\\ncan’t be.', 'Where is the child you have here, my good fellow.', 'You call\\nher Nell.', 'Where is she?’\\n\\nAs he propounded this question, which Kit’s mother echoed, somebody in\\na room near at hand, uttered a great shriek, and a stout lady in a\\nwhite dress came running to the door, and supported herself upon the\\nbridegroom’s arm.', '‘Where is she!’ cried this lady.', '‘What news have you brought me?', 'What\\nhas become of her?’\\n\\nThe single gentleman started back, and gazed upon the face of the late\\nMrs Jarley (that morning wedded to the philosophic George, to the\\neternal wrath and despair of Mr Slum the poet), with looks of\\nconflicting apprehension, disappointment, and incredulity.', 'At length\\nhe stammered out,\\n\\n‘I ask YOU where she is?', 'What do you mean?’\\n\\n‘Oh sir!’ cried the bride, ‘If you have come here to do her any good,\\nwhy weren’t you here a week ago?’\\n\\n‘She is not--not dead?’ said the person to whom she addressed herself,\\nturning very pale.', '‘No, not so bad as that.’\\n\\n‘I thank God!’ cried the single gentleman feebly.', '‘Let me come in.’\\n\\nThey drew back to admit him, and when he had entered, closed the door.', '‘You see in me, good people,’ he said, turning to the newly-married\\ncouple, ‘one to whom life itself is not dearer than the two persons\\nwhom I seek.', 'They would not know me.', 'My features are strange to them,\\nbut if they or either of them are here, take this good woman with you,\\nand let them see her first, for her they both know.', 'If you deny them\\nfrom any mistaken regard or fear for them, judge of my intentions by\\ntheir recognition of this person as their old humble friend.’\\n\\n‘I always said it!’ cried the bride, ‘I knew she was not a common\\nchild!', 'Alas, sir!', 'we have no power to help you, for all that we could\\ndo, has been tried in vain.’\\n\\nWith that, they related to him, without disguise or concealment, all\\nthat they knew of Nell and her grandfather, from their first meeting\\nwith them, down to the time of their sudden disappearance; adding\\n(which was quite true) that they had made every possible effort to\\ntrace them, but without success; having been at first in great alarm\\nfor their safety, as well as on account of the suspicions to which they\\nthemselves might one day be exposed in consequence of their abrupt\\ndeparture.', 'They dwelt upon the old man’s imbecility of mind, upon the\\nuneasiness the child had always testified when he was absent, upon the\\ncompany he had been supposed to keep, and upon the increased depression\\nwhich had gradually crept over her and changed her both in health and\\nspirits.', 'Whether she had missed the old man in the night, and knowing\\nor conjecturing whither he had bent his steps, had gone in pursuit, or\\nwhether they had left the house together, they had no means of\\ndetermining.', 'Certain they considered it, that there was but slender\\nprospect left of hearing of them again, and that whether their flight\\noriginated with the old man, or with the child, there was now no hope\\nof their return.', 'To all this, the single gentleman listened with the\\nair of a man quite borne down by grief and disappointment.', 'He shed\\ntears when they spoke of the grandfather, and appeared in deep\\naffliction.', 'Not to protract this portion of our narrative, and to make short work\\nof a long story, let it be briefly written that before the interview\\ncame to a close, the single gentleman deemed he had sufficient evidence\\nof having been told the truth, and that he endeavoured to force upon\\nthe bride and bridegroom an acknowledgment of their kindness to the\\nunfriended child, which, however, they steadily declined accepting.', 'In\\nthe end, the happy couple jolted away in the caravan to spend their\\nhoneymoon in a country excursion; and the single gentleman and Kit’s\\nmother stood ruefully before their carriage-door.', '‘Where shall we drive you, sir?’ said the post-boy.', '‘You may drive me,’ said the single gentleman, ‘to the--’ He was not\\ngoing to add ‘inn,’ but he added it for the sake of Kit’s mother; and\\nto the inn they went.', 'Rumours had already got abroad that the little girl who used to show\\nthe wax-work, was the child of great people who had been stolen from\\nher parents in infancy, and had only just been traced.', 'Opinion was\\ndivided whether she was the daughter of a prince, a duke, an earl, a\\nviscount, or a baron, but all agreed upon the main fact, and that the\\nsingle gentleman was her father; and all bent forward to catch a\\nglimpse, though it were only of the tip of his noble nose, as he rode\\naway, desponding, in his four-horse chaise.', 'What would he have given to know, and what sorrow would have been saved\\nif he had only known, that at that moment both child and grandfather\\nwere seated in the old church porch, patiently awaiting the\\nschoolmaster’s return!', 'CHAPTER 48\\n\\nPopular rumour concerning the single gentleman and his errand,\\ntravelling from mouth to mouth, and waxing stronger in the marvellous\\nas it was bandied about--for your popular rumour, unlike the rolling\\nstone of the proverb, is one which gathers a deal of moss in its\\nwanderings up and down--occasioned his dismounting at the inn-door to\\nbe looked upon as an exciting and attractive spectacle, which could\\nscarcely be enough admired; and drew together a large concourse of\\nidlers, who having recently been, as it were, thrown out of employment\\nby the closing of the wax-work and the completion of the nuptial\\nceremonies, considered his arrival as little else than a special\\nprovidence, and hailed it with demonstrations of the liveliest joy.', 'Not at all participating in the general sensation, but wearing the\\ndepressed and wearied look of one who sought to meditate on his\\ndisappointment in silence and privacy, the single gentleman alighted,\\nand handed out Kit’s mother with a gloomy politeness which impressed\\nthe lookers-on extremely.', 'That done, he gave her his arm and escorted\\nher into the house, while several active waiters ran on before as a\\nskirmishing party, to clear the way and to show the room which was\\nready for their reception.', '‘Any room will do,’ said the single gentleman.', '‘Let it be near at\\nhand, that’s all.’\\n\\n‘Close here, sir, if you please to walk this way.’\\n\\n‘Would the gentleman like this room?’ said a voice, as a little\\nout-of-the-way door at the foot of the well staircase flew briskly open\\nand a head popped out.', '‘He’s quite welcome to it.', 'He’s as welcome as\\nflowers in May, or coals at Christmas.', 'Would you like this room, sir?', 'Honour me by walking in.', 'Do me the favour, pray.’\\n\\n‘Goodness gracious me!’ cried Kit’s mother, falling back in extreme\\nsurprise, ‘only think of this!’\\n\\nShe had some reason to be astonished, for the person who proffered the\\ngracious invitation was no other than Daniel Quilp.', 'The little door\\nout of which he had thrust his head was close to the inn larder; and\\nthere he stood, bowing with grotesque politeness; as much at his ease\\nas if the door were that of his own house; blighting all the legs of\\nmutton and cold roast fowls by his close companionship, and looking\\nlike the evil genius of the cellars come from underground upon some\\nwork of mischief.', '‘Would you do me the honour?’ said Quilp.', '‘I prefer being alone,’ replied the single gentleman.', '‘Oh!’ said Quilp.', 'And with that, he darted in again with one jerk and\\nclapped the little door to, like a figure in a Dutch clock when the\\nhour strikes.', '‘Why it was only last night, sir,’ whispered Kit’s mother, ‘that I left\\nhim in Little Bethel.’\\n\\n‘Indeed!’ said her fellow-passenger.', '‘When did that person come here,\\nwaiter?’\\n\\n‘Come down by the night-coach, this morning, sir.’\\n\\n‘Humph!', 'And when is he going?’\\n\\n‘Can’t say, sir, really.', 'When the chambermaid asked him just now if he\\nshould want a bed, sir, he first made faces at her, and then wanted to\\nkiss her.’\\n\\n‘Beg him to walk this way,’ said the single gentleman.', '‘I should be\\nglad to exchange a word with him, tell him.', 'Beg him to come at once,\\ndo you hear?’\\n\\nThe man stared on receiving these instructions, for the single\\ngentleman had not only displayed as much astonishment as Kit’s mother\\nat sight of the dwarf, but, standing in no fear of him, had been at\\nless pains to conceal his dislike and repugnance.', 'He departed on his\\nerrand, however, and immediately returned, ushering in its object.', '‘Your servant, sir,’ said the dwarf, ‘I encountered your messenger\\nhalf-way.', 'I thought you’d allow me to pay my compliments to you.', 'I\\nhope you’re well.', 'I hope you’re very well.’\\n\\nThere was a short pause, while the dwarf, with half-shut eyes and\\npuckered face, stood waiting for an answer.', 'Receiving none, he turned\\ntowards his more familiar acquaintance.', '‘Christopher’s mother!’ he cried.', '‘Such a dear lady, such a worthy\\nwoman, so blest in her honest son!', 'How is Christopher’s mother?', 'Have\\nchange of air and scene improved her?', 'Her little family too, and\\nChristopher?', 'Do they thrive?', 'Do they flourish?', 'Are they growing into\\nworthy citizens, eh?’\\n\\nMaking his voice ascend in the scale with every succeeding question, Mr\\nQuilp finished in a shrill squeak, and subsided into the panting look\\nwhich was customary with him, and which, whether it were assumed or\\nnatural, had equally the effect of banishing all expression from his\\nface, and rendering it, as far as it afforded any index to his mood or\\nmeaning, a perfect blank.', '‘Mr Quilp,’ said the single gentleman.', 'The dwarf put his hand to his great flapped ear, and counterfeited the\\nclosest attention.', '‘We two have met before--’\\n\\n‘Surely,’ cried Quilp, nodding his head.', '‘Oh surely, sir.', 'Such an\\nhonour and pleasure--it’s both, Christopher’s mother, it’s both--is\\nnot to be forgotten so soon.', 'By no means!’\\n\\n‘You may remember that the day I arrived in London, and found the house\\nto which I drove, empty and deserted, I was directed by some of the\\nneighbours to you, and waited upon you without stopping for rest or\\nrefreshment?’\\n\\n‘How precipitate that was, and yet what an earnest and vigorous\\nmeasure!’ said Quilp, conferring with himself, in imitation of his\\nfriend Mr Sampson Brass.', '‘I found,’ said the single gentleman, ‘you most unaccountably, in\\npossession of everything that had so recently belonged to another man,\\nand that other man, who up to the time of your entering upon his\\nproperty had been looked upon as affluent, reduced to sudden beggary,\\nand driven from house and home.’\\n\\n‘We had warrant for what we did, my good sir,’ rejoined Quilp, ‘we had\\nour warrant.', 'Don’t say driven either.', 'He went of his own\\naccord--vanished in the night, sir.’\\n\\n‘No matter,’ said the single gentleman angrily.', '‘He was gone.’\\n\\n‘Yes, he was gone,’ said Quilp, with the same exasperating composure.', '‘No doubt he was gone.', 'The only question was, where.', 'And it’s a\\nquestion still.’\\n\\n‘Now, what am I to think,’ said the single gentleman, sternly regarding\\nhim, ‘of you, who, plainly indisposed to give me any information\\nthen--nay, obviously holding back, and sheltering yourself with all\\nkinds of cunning, trickery, and evasion--are dogging my footsteps now?’\\n\\n‘I dogging!’ cried Quilp.', '‘Why, are you not?’ returned his questioner, fretted into a state of\\nthe utmost irritation.', '‘Were you not a few hours since, sixty miles\\noff, and in the chapel to which this good woman goes to say her\\nprayers?’\\n\\n‘She was there too, I think?’ said Quilp, still perfectly unmoved.', '‘I\\nmight say, if I was inclined to be rude, how do I know but you are\\ndogging MY footsteps.', 'Yes, I was at chapel.', 'What then?', 'I’ve read in\\nbooks that pilgrims were used to go to chapel before they went on\\njourneys, to put up petitions for their safe return.', 'Wise men!', 'journeys are very perilous--especially outside the coach.', 'Wheels come\\noff, horses take fright, coachmen drive too fast, coaches overturn.', 'I\\nalways go to chapel before I start on journeys.', 'It’s the last thing I\\ndo on such occasions, indeed.’\\n\\nThat Quilp lied most heartily in this speech, it needed no very great\\npenetration to discover, although for anything that he suffered to\\nappear in his face, voice, or manner, he might have been clinging to\\nthe truth with the quiet constancy of a martyr.', '‘In the name of all that’s calculated to drive one crazy, man,’ said\\nthe unfortunate single gentleman, ‘have you not, for some reason of\\nyour own, taken upon yourself my errand?', 'don’t you know with what\\nobject I have come here, and if you do know, can you throw no light\\nupon it?’\\n\\n‘You think I’m a conjuror, sir,’ replied Quilp, shrugging up his\\nshoulders.', '‘If I was, I should tell my own fortune--and make it.’\\n\\n‘Ah!', 'we have said all we need say, I see,’ returned the other, throwing\\nhimself impatiently upon a sofa.', '‘Pray leave us, if you please.’\\n\\n‘Willingly,’ returned Quilp.', '‘Most willingly.', 'Christopher’s mother,\\nmy good soul, farewell.', 'A pleasant journey--back, sir.', 'Ahem!’\\n\\nWith these parting words, and with a grin upon his features altogether\\nindescribable, but which seemed to be compounded of every monstrous\\ngrimace of which men or monkeys are capable, the dwarf slowly retreated\\nand closed the door behind him.', '‘Oho!’ he said when he had regained his own room, and sat himself down\\nin a chair with his arms akimbo.', '‘Oho!', 'Are you there, my friend?', 'In-deed!’\\n\\nChuckling as though in very great glee, and recompensing himself for\\nthe restraint he had lately put upon his countenance by twisting it\\ninto all imaginable varieties of ugliness, Mr Quilp, rocking himself to\\nand fro in his chair and nursing his left leg at the same time, fell\\ninto certain meditations, of which it may be necessary to relate the\\nsubstance.', 'First, he reviewed the circumstances which had led to his repairing to\\nthat spot, which were briefly these.', 'Dropping in at Mr Sampson Brass’s\\noffice on the previous evening, in the absence of that gentleman and\\nhis learned sister, he had lighted upon Mr Swiveller, who chanced at\\nthe moment to be sprinkling a glass of warm gin and water on the dust\\nof the law, and to be moistening his clay, as the phrase goes, rather\\ncopiously.', 'But as clay in the abstract, when too much moistened,\\nbecomes of a weak and uncertain consistency, breaking down in\\nunexpected places, retaining impressions but faintly, and preserving no\\nstrength or steadiness of character, so Mr Swiveller’s clay, having\\nimbibed a considerable quantity of moisture, was in a very loose and\\nslippery state, insomuch that the various ideas impressed upon it were\\nfast losing their distinctive character, and running into each other.', 'It is not uncommon for human clay in this condition to value itself\\nabove all things upon its great prudence and sagacity; and Mr\\nSwiveller, especially prizing himself upon these qualities, took\\noccasion to remark that he had made strange discoveries in connection\\nwith the single gentleman who lodged above, which he had determined to\\nkeep within his own bosom, and which neither tortures nor cajolery\\nshould ever induce him to reveal.', 'Of this determination Mr Quilp\\nexpressed his high approval, and setting himself in the same breath to\\ngoad Mr Swiveller on to further hints, soon made out that the single\\ngentleman had been seen in communication with Kit, and that this was\\nthe secret which was never to be disclosed.', 'Possessed of this piece of information, Mr Quilp directly supposed that\\nthe single gentleman above stairs must be the same individual who had\\nwaited on him, and having assured himself by further inquiries that\\nthis surmise was correct, had no difficulty in arriving at the\\nconclusion that the intent and object of his correspondence with Kit\\nwas the recovery of his old client and the child.', 'Burning with\\ncuriosity to know what proceedings were afoot, he resolved to pounce\\nupon Kit’s mother as the person least able to resist his arts, and\\nconsequently the most likely to be entrapped into such revelations as\\nhe sought; so taking an abrupt leave of Mr Swiveller, he hurried to her\\nhouse.', 'The good woman being from home, he made inquiries of a\\nneighbour, as Kit himself did soon afterwards, and being directed to\\nthe chapel be took himself there, in order to waylay her, at the\\nconclusion of the service.', 'He had not sat in the chapel more than a quarter of an hour, and with\\nhis eyes piously fixed upon the ceiling was chuckling inwardly over the\\njoke of his being there at all, when Kit himself appeared.', 'Watchful as\\na lynx, one glance showed the dwarf that he had come on business.', 'Absorbed in appearance, as we have seen, and feigning a profound\\nabstraction, he noted every circumstance of his behaviour, and when he\\nwithdrew with his family, shot out after him.', 'In fine, he traced them\\nto the notary’s house; learnt the destination of the carriage from one\\nof the postilions; and knowing that a fast night-coach started for the\\nsame place, at the very hour which was on the point of striking, from a\\nstreet hard by, darted round to the coach-office without more ado, and\\ntook his seat upon the roof.', 'After passing and repassing the carriage\\non the road, and being passed and repassed by it sundry times in the\\ncourse of the night, according as their stoppages were longer or\\nshorter; or their rate of travelling varied, they reached the town\\nalmost together.', 'Quilp kept the chaise in sight, mingled with the\\ncrowd, learnt the single gentleman’s errand, and its failure, and\\nhaving possessed himself of all that it was material to know, hurried\\noff, reached the inn before him, had the interview just now detailed,\\nand shut himself up in the little room in which he hastily reviewed all\\nthese occurrences.', '‘You are there, are you, my friend?’ he repeated, greedily biting his\\nnails.', '‘I am suspected and thrown aside, and Kit’s the confidential\\nagent, is he?', 'I shall have to dispose of him, I fear.', 'If we had come\\nup with them this morning,’ he continued, after a thoughtful pause, ‘I\\nwas ready to prove a pretty good claim.', 'I could have made my profit.', 'But for these canting hypocrites, the lad and his mother, I could get\\nthis fiery gentleman as comfortably into my net as our old friend--our\\nmutual friend, ha!', 'ha!--and chubby, rosy Nell.', 'At the worst, it’s a\\ngolden opportunity, not to be lost.', 'Let us find them first, and I’ll\\nfind means of draining you of some of your superfluous cash, sir, while\\nthere are prison bars, and bolts, and locks, to keep your friend or\\nkinsman safely.', 'I hate your virtuous people!’ said the dwarf, throwing\\noff a bumper of brandy, and smacking his lips, ‘ah!', 'I hate ‘em every\\none!’\\n\\nThis was not a mere empty vaunt, but a deliberate avowal of his real\\nsentiments; for Mr Quilp, who loved nobody, had by little and little\\ncome to hate everybody nearly or remotely connected with his ruined\\nclient:--the old man himself, because he had been able to deceive him\\nand elude his vigilance--the child, because she was the object of Mrs\\nQuilp’s commiseration and constant self-reproach--the single gentleman,\\nbecause of his unconcealed aversion to himself--Kit and his mother,\\nmost mortally, for the reasons shown.', 'Above and beyond that general\\nfeeling of opposition to them, which would have been inseparable from\\nhis ravenous desire to enrich himself by these altered circumstances,\\nDaniel Quilp hated them every one.', 'In this amiable mood, Mr Quilp enlivened himself and his hatreds with\\nmore brandy, and then, changing his quarters, withdrew to an obscure\\nalehouse, under cover of which seclusion he instituted all possible\\ninquiries that might lead to the discovery of the old man and his\\ngrandchild.', 'But all was in vain.', 'Not the slightest trace or clue\\ncould be obtained.', 'They had left the town by night; no one had seen\\nthem go; no one had met them on the road; the driver of no coach, cart,\\nor waggon, had seen any travellers answering their description; nobody\\nhad fallen in with them, or heard of them.', 'Convinced at last that for\\nthe present all such attempts were hopeless, he appointed two or three\\nscouts, with promises of large rewards in case of their forwarding him\\nany intelligence, and returned to London by next day’s coach.', 'It was some gratification to Mr Quilp to find, as he took his place\\nupon the roof, that Kit’s mother was alone inside; from which\\ncircumstance he derived in the course of the journey much cheerfulness\\nof spirit, inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify\\nher with many extraordinary annoyances; such as hanging over the side\\nof the coach at the risk of his life, and staring in with his great\\ngoggle eyes, which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being\\nupside down; dodging her in this way from one window to another;\\ngetting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head\\nin at the window with a dismal squint: which ingenious tortures had\\nsuch an effect upon Mrs Nubbles, that she was quite unable for the time\\nto resist the belief that Mr Quilp did in his own person represent and\\nembody that Evil Power, who was so vigorously attacked at Little\\nBethel, and who, by reason of her backslidings in respect of Astley’s\\nand oysters, was now frolicsome and rampant.', 'Kit, having been apprised by letter of his mother’s intended return,\\nwas waiting for her at the coach-office; and great was his surprise\\nwhen he saw, leering over the coachman’s shoulder like some familiar\\ndemon, invisible to all eyes but his, the well-known face of Quilp.', '‘How are you, Christopher?’ croaked the dwarf from the coach-top.', '‘All\\nright, Christopher.', 'Mother’s inside.’\\n\\n‘Why, how did he come here, mother?’ whispered Kit.', '‘I don’t know how he came or why, my dear,’ rejoined Mrs Nubbles,\\ndismounting with her son’s assistance, ‘but he has been a terrifying of\\nme out of my seven senses all this blessed day.’\\n\\n‘He has?’ cried Kit.', '‘You wouldn’t believe it, that you wouldn’t,’ replied his mother, ‘but\\ndon’t say a word to him, for I really don’t believe he’s human.', 'Hush!', 'Don’t turn round as if I was talking of him, but he’s a squinting at me\\nnow in the full blaze of the coach-lamp, quite awful!’\\n\\nIn spite of his mother’s injunction, Kit turned sharply round to look.', 'Mr Quilp was serenely gazing at the stars, quite absorbed in celestial\\ncontemplation.', '‘Oh, he’s the artfullest creetur!’ cried Mrs Nubbles.', '‘But come away.', 'Don’t speak to him for the world.’\\n\\n‘Yes I will, mother.', 'What nonsense.', 'I say, sir--’\\n\\nMr Quilp affected to start, and looked smilingly round.', '‘You let my mother alone, will you?’ said Kit.', '‘How dare you tease a\\npoor lone woman like her, making her miserable and melancholy as if she\\nhadn’t got enough to make her so, without you.', 'An’t you ashamed of\\nyourself, you little monster?’\\n\\n‘Monster!’ said Quilp inwardly, with a smile.', '‘Ugliest dwarf that\\ncould be seen anywhere for a penny--monster--ah!’\\n\\n‘You show her any of your impudence again,’ resumed Kit, shouldering\\nthe bandbox, ‘and I tell you what, Mr Quilp, I won’t bear with you any\\nmore.', 'You have no right to do it; I’m sure we never interfered with\\nyou.', 'This isn’t the first time; and if ever you worry or frighten her\\nagain, you’ll oblige me (though I should be very sorry to do it, on\\naccount of your size) to beat you.’\\n\\nQuilp said not a word in reply, but walking so close to Kit as to bring\\nhis eyes within two or three inches of his face, looked fixedly at him,\\nretreated a little distance without averting his gaze, approached\\nagain, again withdrew, and so on for half-a-dozen times, like a head in\\na phantasmagoria.', 'Kit stood his ground as if in expectation of an\\nimmediate assault, but finding that nothing came of these gestures,\\nsnapped his fingers and walked away; his mother dragging him off as\\nfast as she could, and, even in the midst of his news of little Jacob\\nand the baby, looking anxiously over her shoulder to see if Quilp were\\nfollowing.', 'CHAPTER 49\\n\\nKit’s mother might have spared herself the trouble of looking back so\\noften, for nothing was further from Mr Quilp’s thoughts than any\\nintention of pursuing her and her son, or renewing the quarrel with\\nwhich they had parted.', 'He went his way, whistling from time to time\\nsome fragments of a tune; and with a face quite tranquil and composed,\\njogged pleasantly towards home; entertaining himself as he went with\\nvisions of the fears and terrors of Mrs Quilp, who, having received no\\nintelligence of him for three whole days and two nights, and having had\\nno previous notice of his absence, was doubtless by that time in a\\nstate of distraction, and constantly fainting away with anxiety and\\ngrief.', 'This facetious probability was so congenial to the dwarf’s humour, and\\nso exquisitely amusing to him, that he laughed as he went along until\\nthe tears ran down his cheeks; and more than once, when he found\\nhimself in a bye-street, vented his delight in a shrill scream, which\\ngreatly terrifying any lonely passenger, who happened to be walking on\\nbefore him expecting nothing so little, increased his mirth, and made\\nhim remarkably cheerful and light-hearted.', 'In this happy flow of spirits, Mr Quilp reached Tower Hill, when,\\ngazing up at the window of his own sitting-room, he thought he descried\\nmore light than is usual in a house of mourning.', 'Drawing nearer, and\\nlistening attentively, he could hear several voices in earnest\\nconversation, among which he could distinguish, not only those of his\\nwife and mother-in-law, but the tongues of men.', '‘Ha!’ cried the jealous dwarf, ‘What’s this!', 'Do they entertain\\nvisitors while I’m away!’\\n\\nA smothered cough from above, was the reply.', 'He felt in his pockets\\nfor his latch-key, but had forgotten it.', 'There was no resource but to\\nknock at the door.', '‘A light in the passage,’ said Quilp, peeping through the keyhole.', '‘A\\nvery soft knock; and, by your leave, my lady, I may yet steal upon you\\nunawares.', 'Soho!’\\n\\nA very low and gentle rap received no answer from within.', 'But after a\\nsecond application to the knocker, no louder than the first, the door\\nwas softly opened by the boy from the wharf, whom Quilp instantly\\ngagged with one hand, and dragged into the street with the other.', '‘You’ll throttle me, master,’ whispered the boy.', '‘Let go, will you.’\\n\\n‘Who’s up stairs, you dog?’ retorted Quilp in the same tone.', '‘Tell me.', 'And don’t speak above your breath, or I’ll choke you in good earnest.’\\n\\nThe boy could only point to the window, and reply with a stifled\\ngiggle, expressive of such intense enjoyment, that Quilp clutched him\\nby the throat and might have carried his threat into execution, or at\\nleast have made very good progress towards that end, but for the boy’s\\nnimbly extricating himself from his grasp, and fortifying himself\\nbehind the nearest post, at which, after some fruitless attempts to\\ncatch him by the hair of the head, his master was obliged to come to a\\nparley.', '‘Will you answer me?’ said Quilp.', '‘What’s going on, above?’\\n\\n‘You won’t let one speak,’ replied the boy.', '‘They--ha, ha, ha!--they\\nthink you’re--you’re dead.', 'Ha ha ha!’\\n\\n‘Dead!’ cried Quilp, relaxing into a grim laugh himself.', '‘No.', 'Do\\nthey?', 'Do they really, you dog?’\\n\\n‘They think you’re--you’re drowned,’ replied the boy, who in his\\nmalicious nature had a strong infusion of his master.', '‘You was last\\nseen on the brink of the wharf, and they think you tumbled over.', 'Ha\\nha!’\\n\\nThe prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances, and\\nof disappointing them all by walking in alive, gave more delight to\\nQuilp than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have\\ninspired him with.', 'He was no less tickled than his hopeful assistant,\\nand they both stood for some seconds, grinning and gasping and wagging\\ntheir heads at each other, on either side of the post, like an\\nunmatchable pair of Chinese idols.', '‘Not a word,’ said Quilp, making towards the door on tiptoe.', '‘Not a\\nsound, not so much as a creaking board, or a stumble against a cobweb.', 'Drowned, eh, Mrs Quilp!', 'Drowned!’\\n\\nSo saying, he blew out the candle, kicked off his shoes, and groped his\\nway up stairs; leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of\\nsummersets on the pavement.', 'The bedroom-door on the staircase being unlocked, Mr Quilp slipped in,\\nand planted himself behind the door of communication between that\\nchamber and the sitting-room, which standing ajar to render both more\\nairy, and having a very convenient chink (of which he had often availed\\nhimself for purposes of espial, and had indeed enlarged with his\\npocket-knife), enabled him not only to hear, but to see distinctly,\\nwhat was passing.', 'Applying his eye to this convenient place, he descried Mr Brass seated\\nat the table with pen, ink, and paper, and the case-bottle of rum--his\\nown case-bottle, and his own particular Jamaica--convenient to his\\nhand; with hot water, fragrant lemons, white lump sugar, and all things\\nfitting; from which choice materials, Sampson, by no means insensible\\nto their claims upon his attention, had compounded a mighty glass of\\npunch reeking hot; which he was at that very moment stirring up with a\\nteaspoon, and contemplating with looks in which a faint assumption of\\nsentimental regret, struggled but weakly with a bland and comfortable\\njoy.', 'At the same table, with both her elbows upon it, was Mrs Jiniwin;\\nno longer sipping other people’s punch feloniously with teaspoons, but\\ntaking deep draughts from a jorum of her own; while her daughter--not\\nexactly with ashes on her head, or sackcloth on her back, but\\npreserving a very decent and becoming appearance of sorrow\\nnevertheless--was reclining in an easy chair, and soothing her grief\\nwith a smaller allowance of the same glib liquid.', 'There were also\\npresent, a couple of water-side men, bearing between them certain\\nmachines called drags; even these fellows were accommodated with a\\nstiff glass a-piece; and as they drank with a great relish, and were\\nnaturally of a red-nosed, pimple-faced, convivial look, their presence\\nrather increased than detracted from that decided appearance of\\ncomfort, which was the great characteristic of the party.', '‘If I could poison that dear old lady’s rum and water,’ murmured Quilp,\\n‘I’d die happy.’\\n\\n‘Ah!’ said Mr Brass, breaking the silence, and raising his eyes to the\\nceiling with a sigh, ‘Who knows but he may be looking down upon us now!', 'Who knows but he may be surveying of us from--from somewheres or\\nanother, and contemplating us with a watchful eye!', 'Oh Lor!’\\n\\nHere Mr Brass stopped to drink half his punch, and then resumed;\\nlooking at the other half, as he spoke, with a dejected smile.', '‘I can almost fancy,’ said the lawyer shaking his head, ‘that I see his\\neye glistening down at the very bottom of my liquor.', 'When shall we\\nlook upon his like again?', 'Never, never!’ One minute we are\\nhere’--holding his tumbler before his eyes--‘the next we are\\nthere’--gulping down its contents, and striking himself emphatically a\\nlittle below the chest--‘in the silent tomb.', 'To think that I should be\\ndrinking his very rum!', 'It seems like a dream.’\\n\\nWith the view, no doubt, of testing the reality of his position, Mr\\nBrass pushed his tumbler as he spoke towards Mrs Jiniwin for the\\npurpose of being replenished; and turned towards the attendant mariners.', '‘The search has been quite unsuccessful then?’\\n\\n‘Quite, master.', 'But I should say that if he turns up anywhere, he’ll\\ncome ashore somewhere about Grinidge to-morrow, at ebb tide, eh, mate?’\\n\\nThe other gentleman assented, observing that he was expected at the\\nHospital, and that several pensioners would be ready to receive him\\nwhenever he arrived.', '‘Then we have nothing for it but resignation,’ said Mr Brass; ‘nothing\\nbut resignation and expectation.', 'It would be a comfort to have his\\nbody; it would be a dreary comfort.’\\n\\n‘Oh, beyond a doubt,’ assented Mrs Jiniwin hastily; ‘if we once had\\nthat, we should be quite sure.’\\n\\n‘With regard to the descriptive advertisement,’ said Sampson Brass,\\ntaking up his pen.', '‘It is a melancholy pleasure to recall his traits.', 'Respecting his legs now--?’\\n\\n‘Crooked, certainly,’ said Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘Do you think they WERE\\ncrooked?’ said Brass, in an insinuating tone.', '‘I think I see them now\\ncoming up the street very wide apart, in nankeen’ pantaloons a little\\nshrunk and without straps.', 'Ah!', 'what a vale of tears we live in.', 'Do we\\nsay crooked?’\\n\\n‘I think they were a little so,’ observed Mrs Quilp with a sob.', '‘Legs crooked,’ said Brass, writing as he spoke.', '‘Large head, short\\nbody, legs crooked--’\\n\\n‘Very crooked,’ suggested Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘We’ll not say very crooked, ma’am,’ said Brass piously.', '‘Let us not\\nbear hard upon the weaknesses of the deceased.', 'He is gone, ma’am, to\\nwhere his legs will never come in question.--We will content ourselves\\nwith crooked, Mrs Jiniwin.’\\n\\n‘I thought you wanted the truth,’ said the old lady.', '‘That’s all.’\\n\\n‘Bless your eyes, how I love you,’ muttered Quilp.', '‘There she goes\\nagain.', 'Nothing but punch!’\\n\\n‘This is an occupation,’ said the lawyer, laying down his pen and\\nemptying his glass, ‘which seems to bring him before my eyes like the\\nGhost of Hamlet’s father, in the very clothes that he wore on\\nwork-a-days.', 'His coat, his waistcoat, his shoes and stockings, his\\ntrousers, his hat, his wit and humour, his pathos and his umbrella, all\\ncome before me like visions of my youth.', 'His linen!’ said Mr Brass\\nsmiling fondly at the wall, ‘his linen which was always of a particular\\ncolour, for such was his whim and fancy--how plain I see his linen now!’\\n\\n‘You had better go on, sir,’ said Mrs Jiniwin impatiently.', '‘True, ma’am, true,’ cried Mr Brass.', '‘Our faculties must not freeze\\nwith grief.', 'I’ll trouble you for a little more of that, ma’am.', 'A\\nquestion now arises, with relation to his nose.’\\n\\n‘Flat,’ said Mrs Jiniwin.', '‘Aquiline!’ cried Quilp, thrusting in his head, and striking the\\nfeature with his fist.', '‘Aquiline, you hag.', 'Do you see it?', 'Do you\\ncall this flat?', 'Do you?', 'Eh?’\\n\\n‘Oh capital, capital!’ shouted Brass, from the mere force of habit.', '‘Excellent!', 'How very good he is!', 'He’s a most remarkable man--so\\nextremely whimsical!', 'Such an amazing power of taking people by\\nsurprise!’\\n\\nQuilp paid no regard whatever to these compliments, nor to the dubious\\nand frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided, nor to\\nthe shrieks of his wife and mother-in-law, nor to the latter’s running\\nfrom the room, nor to the former’s fainting away.', 'Keeping his eye\\nfixed on Sampson Brass, he walked up to the table, and beginning with\\nhis glass, drank off the contents, and went regularly round until he\\nhad emptied the other two, when he seized the case-bottle, and hugging\\nit under his arm, surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer.', '‘Not yet, Sampson,’ said Quilp.', '‘Not just yet!’\\n\\n‘Oh very good indeed!’ cried Brass, recovering his spirits a little.', '‘Ha ha ha!', 'Oh exceedingly good!', 'There’s not another man alive who\\ncould carry it off like that.', 'A most difficult position to carry off.', 'But he has such a flow of good-humour, such an amazing flow!’\\n\\n‘Good night,’ said the dwarf, nodding expressively.', '‘Good night, sir, good night,’ cried the lawyer, retreating backwards\\ntowards the door.', '‘This is a joyful occasion indeed, extremely joyful.', 'Ha ha ha!', 'oh very rich, very rich indeed, remarkably so!’\\n\\nWaiting until Mr Brass’s ejaculations died away in the distance (for he\\ncontinued to pour them out, all the way down stairs), Quilp advanced\\ntowards the two men, who yet lingered in a kind of stupid amazement.', '‘Have you been dragging the river all day, gentlemen?’ said the dwarf,\\nholding the door open with great politeness.', '‘And yesterday too, master.’\\n\\n‘Dear me, you’ve had a deal of trouble.', 'Pray consider everything yours\\nthat you find upon the--upon the body.', 'Good night!’\\n\\nThe men looked at each other, but had evidently no inclination to argue\\nthe point just then, and shuffled out of the room.', 'The speedy\\nclearance effected, Quilp locked the doors; and still embracing the\\ncase-bottle with shrugged-up shoulders and folded arms, stood looking\\nat his insensible wife like a dismounted nightmare.', 'CHAPTER 50\\n\\nMatrimonial differences are usually discussed by the parties concerned\\nin the form of dialogue, in which the lady bears at least her full half\\nshare.', 'Those of Mr and Mrs Quilp, however, were an exception to the\\ngeneral rule; the remarks which they occasioned being limited to a long\\nsoliloquy on the part of the gentleman, with perhaps a few deprecatory\\nobservations from the lady, not extending beyond a trembling\\nmonosyllable uttered at long intervals, and in a very submissive and\\nhumble tone.', 'On the present occasion, Mrs Quilp did not for a long\\ntime venture even on this gentle defence, but when she had recovered\\nfrom her fainting-fit, sat in a tearful silence, meekly listening to\\nthe reproaches of her lord and master.', 'Of these Mr Quilp delivered himself with the utmost animation and\\nrapidity, and with so many distortions of limb and feature, that even\\nhis wife, although tolerably well accustomed to his proficiency in\\nthese respects, was well-nigh beside herself with alarm.', 'But the\\nJamaica rum, and the joy of having occasioned a heavy disappointment,\\nby degrees cooled Mr Quilp’s wrath; which from being at savage heat,\\ndropped slowly to the bantering or chuckling point, at which it\\nsteadily remained.', '‘So you thought I was dead and gone, did you?’ said Quilp.', '‘You\\nthought you were a widow, eh?', 'Ha, ha, ha, you jade.’\\n\\n‘Indeed, Quilp,’ returned his wife.', '‘I’m very sorry--’\\n\\n‘Who doubts it!’ cried the dwarf.', '‘You very sorry!', 'to be sure you are.', 'Who doubts that you’re VERY sorry!’\\n\\n‘I don’t mean sorry that you have come home again alive and well,’ said\\nhis wife, ‘but sorry that I should have been led into such a belief.', 'I\\nam glad to see you, Quilp; indeed I am.’\\n\\nIn truth Mrs Quilp did seem a great deal more glad to behold her lord\\nthan might have been expected, and did evince a degree of interest in\\nhis safety which, all things considered, was rather unaccountable.', 'Upon Quilp, however, this circumstance made no impression, farther than\\nas it moved him to snap his fingers close to his wife’s eyes, with\\ndivers grins of triumph and derision.', '‘How could you go away so long, without saying a word to me or letting\\nme hear of you or know anything about you?’ asked the poor little\\nwoman, sobbing.', '‘How could you be so cruel, Quilp?’\\n\\n‘How could I be so cruel!', 'cruel!’ cried the dwarf.', '‘Because I was in\\nthe humour.', 'I’m in the humour now.', 'I shall be cruel when I like.', 'I’m\\ngoing away again.’\\n\\n‘Not again!’\\n\\n‘Yes, again.', 'I’m going away now.', 'I’m off directly.', 'I mean to go and\\nlive wherever the fancy seizes me--at the wharf--at the\\ncounting-house--and be a jolly bachelor.', 'You were a widow in\\nanticipation.', 'Damme,’ screamed the dwarf, ‘I’ll be a bachelor in\\nearnest.’\\n\\n‘You can’t be serious, Quilp,’ sobbed his wife.', '‘I tell you,’ said the dwarf, exulting in his project, ‘that I’ll be a\\nbachelor, a devil-may-care bachelor; and I’ll have my bachelor’s hall\\nat the counting-house, and at such times come near it if you dare.', 'And\\nmind too that I don’t pounce in upon you at unseasonable hours again,\\nfor I’ll be a spy upon you, and come and go like a mole or a weazel.', 'Tom Scott--where’s Tom Scott?’\\n\\n‘Here I am, master,’ cried the voice of the boy, as Quilp threw up the\\nwindow.', '‘Wait there, you dog,’ returned the dwarf, ‘to carry a bachelor’s\\nportmanteau.', 'Pack it up, Mrs Quilp.', 'Knock up the dear old lady to\\nhelp; knock her up.', 'Halloa there!', 'Halloa!’\\n\\nWith these exclamations, Mr Quilp caught up the poker, and hurrying to\\nthe door of the good lady’s sleeping-closet, beat upon it therewith\\nuntil she awoke in inexpressible terror, thinking that her amiable\\nson-in-law surely intended to murder her in justification of the legs\\nshe had slandered.', 'Impressed with this idea, she was no sooner fairly\\nawake than she screamed violently, and would have quickly precipitated\\nherself out of the window and through a neighbouring skylight, if her\\ndaughter had not hastened in to undeceive her, and implore her\\nassistance.', 'Somewhat reassured by her account of the service she was\\nrequired to render, Mrs Jiniwin made her appearance in a flannel\\ndressing-gown; and both mother and daughter, trembling with terror and\\ncold--for the night was now far advanced--obeyed Mr Quilp’s directions\\nin submissive silence.', 'Prolonging his preparations as much as\\npossible, for their greater comfort, that eccentric gentleman\\nsuperintended the packing of his wardrobe, and having added to it with\\nhis own hands, a plate, knife and fork, spoon, teacup and saucer, and\\nother small household matters of that nature, strapped up the\\nportmanteau, took it on his shoulders, and actually marched off without\\nanother word, and with the case-bottle (which he had never once put\\ndown) still tightly clasped under his arm.', 'Consigning his heavier\\nburden to the care of Tom Scott when he reached the street, taking a\\ndram from the bottle for his own encouragement, and giving the boy a\\nrap on the head with it as a small taste for himself, Quilp very\\ndeliberately led the way to the wharf, and reached it at between three\\nand four o’clock in the morning.', '‘Snug!’ said Quilp, when he had groped his way to the wooden\\ncounting-house, and opened the door with a key he carried about with\\nhim.', '‘Beautifully snug!', 'Call me at eight, you dog.’\\n\\nWith no more formal leave-taking or explanation, he clutched the\\nportmanteau, shut the door on his attendant, and climbing on the desk,\\nand rolling himself up as round as a hedgehog, in an old boat-cloak,\\nfell fast asleep.', 'Being roused in the morning at the appointed time, and roused with\\ndifficulty, after his late fatigues, Quilp instructed Tom Scott to make\\na fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber, and to prepare some\\ncoffee for breakfast; for the better furnishing of which repast he\\nentrusted him with certain small moneys, to be expended in the purchase\\nof hot rolls, butter, sugar, Yarmouth bloaters, and other articles of\\nhousekeeping; so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on\\nthe board.', 'With this substantial comfort, the dwarf regaled himself to\\nhis heart’s content; and being highly satisfied with this free and\\ngipsy mode of life (which he had often meditated, as offering, whenever\\nhe chose to avail himself of it, an agreeable freedom from the\\nrestraints of matrimony, and a choice means of keeping Mrs Quilp and\\nher mother in a state of incessant agitation and suspense), bestirred\\nhimself to improve his retreat, and render it more commodious and\\ncomfortable.', 'With this view, he issued forth to a place hard by, where sea-stores\\nwere sold, purchased a second-hand hammock, and had it slung in\\nseamanlike fashion from the ceiling of the counting-house.', 'He also\\ncaused to be erected, in the same mouldy cabin, an old ship’s stove\\nwith a rusty funnel to carry the smoke through the roof; and these\\narrangements completed, surveyed them with ineffable delight.', '‘I’ve got a country-house like Robinson Crusoe,’ said the dwarf, ogling\\nthe accommodations; ‘a solitary, sequestered, desolate-island sort of\\nspot, where I can be quite alone when I have business on hand, and be\\nsecure from all spies and listeners.', 'Nobody near me here, but rats,\\nand they are fine stealthy secret fellows.', 'I shall be as merry as a\\ngrig among these gentry.', 'I’ll look out for one like Christopher, and\\npoison him--ha, ha, ha!', 'Business though--business--we must be mindful\\nof business in the midst of pleasure, and the time has flown this\\nmorning, I declare.’\\n\\nEnjoining Tom Scott to await his return, and not to stand upon his\\nhead, or throw a summerset, or so much as walk upon his hands\\nmeanwhile, on pain of lingering torments, the dwarf threw himself into\\na boat, and crossing to the other side of the river, and then speeding\\naway on foot, reached Mr Swiveller’s usual house of entertainment in\\nBevis Marks, just as that gentleman sat down alone to dinner in its\\ndusky parlour.', '‘Dick,’ said the dwarf, thrusting his head in at the door, ‘my pet, my\\npupil, the apple of my eye, hey, hey!’\\n\\n‘Oh you’re there, are you?’ returned Mr Swiveller; ‘how are you?’\\n\\n‘How’s Dick?’ retorted Quilp.', '‘How’s the cream of clerkship, eh?’\\n\\n‘Why, rather sour, sir,’ replied Mr Swiveller.', '‘Beginning to border\\nupon cheesiness, in fact.’\\n\\n‘What’s the matter?’ said the dwarf, advancing.', '‘Has Sally proved\\nunkind.', '“Of all the girls that are so smart, there’s none like--” eh,\\nDick!’\\n\\n‘Certainly not,’ replied Mr Swiveller, eating his dinner with great\\ngravity, ‘none like her.', 'She’s the sphynx of private life, is Sally B.’\\n\\n‘You’re out of spirits,’ said Quilp, drawing up a chair.', '‘What’s the\\nmatter?’\\n\\n‘The law don’t agree with me,’ returned Dick.', '‘It isn’t moist enough,\\nand there’s too much confinement.', 'I have been thinking of running\\naway.’\\n\\n‘Bah!’ said the dwarf.', '‘Where would you run to, Dick?’\\n\\n‘I don’t know’ returned Mr Swiveller.', '‘Towards Highgate, I suppose.', 'Perhaps the bells might strike up “Turn again Swiveller, Lord Mayor of\\nLondon.” Whittington’s name was Dick.', 'I wish cats were scarcer.’\\n\\nQuilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical\\nexpression of curiosity, and patiently awaited his further explanation;\\nupon which, however, Mr Swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter, as he\\nate a very long dinner in profound silence, finally pushed away his\\nplate, threw himself back into his chair, folded his arms, and stared\\nruefully at the fire, in which some ends of cigars were smoking on\\ntheir own account, and sending up a fragrant odour.', '‘Perhaps you’d like a bit of cake’--said Dick, at last turning to the\\ndwarf.', '‘You’re quite welcome to it.', 'You ought to be, for it’s of your\\nmaking.’\\n\\n‘What do you mean?’ said Quilp.', 'Mr Swiveller replied by taking from his pocket a small and very greasy\\nparcel, slowly unfolding it, and displaying a little slab of plum-cake\\nextremely indigestible in appearance, and bordered with a paste of\\nwhite sugar an inch and a half deep.', '‘What should you say this was?’ demanded Mr Swiveller.', '‘It looks like bride-cake,’ replied the dwarf, grinning.', '‘And whose should you say it was?’ inquired Mr Swiveller, rubbing the\\npastry against his nose with a dreadful calmness.', '‘Whose?’\\n\\n‘Not--’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Dick, ‘the same.', 'You needn’t mention her name.', 'There’s no\\nsuch name now.', 'Her name is Cheggs now, Sophy Cheggs.', 'Yet loved I as\\nman never loved that hadn’t wooden legs, and my heart, my heart is\\nbreaking for the love of Sophy Cheggs.’\\n\\nWith this extemporary adaptation of a popular ballad to the distressing\\ncircumstances of his own case, Mr Swiveller folded up the parcel again,\\nbeat it very flat between the palms of his hands, thrust it into his\\nbreast, buttoned his coat over it, and folded his arms upon the whole.', '‘Now, I hope you’re satisfied, sir,’ said Dick; ‘and I hope Fred’s\\nsatisfied.', 'You went partners in the mischief, and I hope you like it.', 'This is the triumph I was to have, is it?', 'It’s like the old\\ncountry-dance of that name, where there are two gentlemen to one lady,\\nand one has her, and the other hasn’t, but comes limping up behind to\\nmake out the figure.', 'But it’s Destiny, and mine’s a crusher.’\\n\\nDisguising his secret joy in Mr Swiveller’s defeat, Daniel Quilp\\nadopted the surest means of soothing him, by ringing the bell, and\\nordering in a supply of rosy wine (that is to say, of its usual\\nrepresentative), which he put about with great alacrity, calling upon\\nMr Swiveller to pledge him in various toasts derisive of Cheggs, and\\neulogistic of the happiness of single men.', 'Such was their impression\\non Mr Swiveller, coupled with the reflection that no man could oppose\\nhis destiny, that in a very short space of time his spirits rose\\nsurprisingly, and he was enabled to give the dwarf an account of the\\nreceipt of the cake, which, it appeared, had been brought to Bevis\\nMarks by the two surviving Miss Wackleses in person, and delivered at\\nthe office door with much giggling and joyfulness.', '‘Ha!’ said Quilp.', '‘It will be our turn to giggle soon.', 'And that\\nreminds me--you spoke of young Trent--where is he?’\\n\\nMr Swiveller explained that his respectable friend had recently\\naccepted a responsible situation in a locomotive gaming-house, and was\\nat that time absent on a professional tour among the adventurous\\nspirits of Great Britain.', '‘That’s unfortunate,’ said the dwarf, ‘for I came, in fact, to ask you\\nabout him.', 'A thought has occurred to me, Dick; your friend over the\\nway--’\\n\\n‘Which friend?’\\n\\n‘In the first floor.’\\n\\n‘Yes?’\\n\\n‘Your friend in the first floor, Dick, may know him.’\\n\\n‘No, he don’t,’ said Mr Swiveller, shaking his head.', '‘Don’t!', 'No, because he has never seen him,’ rejoined Quilp; ‘but if we\\nwere to bring them together, who knows, Dick, but Fred, properly\\nintroduced, would serve his turn almost as well as little Nell or her\\ngrandfather--who knows but it might make the young fellow’s fortune,\\nand, through him, yours, eh?’\\n\\n‘Why, the fact is, you see,’ said Mr Swiveller, ‘that they HAVE been\\nbrought together.’\\n\\n‘Have been!’ cried the dwarf, looking suspiciously at his companion.', '‘Through whose means?’\\n\\n‘Through mine,’ said Dick, slightly confused.', '‘Didn’t I mention it to\\nyou the last time you called over yonder?’\\n\\n‘You know you didn’t,’ returned the dwarf.', '‘I believe you’re right,’ said Dick.', '‘No.', 'I didn’t, I recollect.', 'Oh\\nyes, I brought ‘em together that very day.', 'It was Fred’s suggestion.’\\n\\n‘And what came of it?’\\n\\n‘Why, instead of my friend’s bursting into tears when he knew who Fred\\nwas, embracing him kindly, and telling him that he was his grandfather,\\nor his grandmother in disguise (which we fully expected), he flew into\\na tremendous passion; called him all manner of names; said it was in a\\ngreat measure his fault that little Nell and the old gentleman had ever\\nbeen brought to poverty; didn’t hint at our taking anything to drink;\\nand--and in short rather turned us out of the room than otherwise.’\\n\\n‘That’s strange,’ said the dwarf, musing.', '‘So we remarked to each other at the time,’ returned Dick coolly, ‘but\\nquite true.’\\n\\nQuilp was plainly staggered by this intelligence, over which he brooded\\nfor some time in moody silence, often raising his eyes to Mr\\nSwiveller’s face, and sharply scanning its expression.', 'As he could\\nread in it, however, no additional information or anything to lead him\\nto believe he had spoken falsely; and as Mr Swiveller, left to his own\\nmeditations, sighed deeply, and was evidently growing maudlin on the\\nsubject of Mrs Cheggs; the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took\\nhis departure, leaving the bereaved one to his melancholy ruminations.', '‘Have been brought together, eh?’ said the dwarf as he walked the\\nstreets alone.', '‘My friend has stolen a march upon me.', 'It led him to\\nnothing, and therefore is no great matter, save in the intention.', 'I’m\\nglad he has lost his mistress.', 'Ha ha!', 'The blockhead mustn’t leave the\\nlaw at present.', 'I’m sure of him where he is, whenever I want him for\\nmy own purposes, and, besides, he’s a good unconscious spy on Brass,\\nand tells, in his cups, all that he sees and hears.', 'You’re useful to\\nme, Dick, and cost nothing but a little treating now and then.', 'I am\\nnot sure that it may not be worth while, before long, to take credit\\nwith the stranger, Dick, by discovering your designs upon the child;\\nbut for the present we’ll remain the best friends in the world, with\\nyour good leave.’\\n\\nPursuing these thoughts, and gasping as he went along, after his own\\npeculiar fashion, Mr Quilp once more crossed the Thames, and shut\\nhimself up in his Bachelor’s Hall, which, by reason of its\\nnewly-erected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying\\nnone of it off, was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people\\nmight have desired.', 'Such inconveniences, however, instead of\\ndisgusting the dwarf with his new abode, rather suited his humour; so,\\nafter dining luxuriously from the public-house, he lighted his pipe,\\nand smoked against the chimney until nothing of him was visible through\\nthe mist but a pair of red and highly inflamed eyes, with sometimes a\\ndim vision of his head and face, as, in a violent fit of coughing, he\\nslightly stirred the smoke and scattered the heavy wreaths by which\\nthey were obscured.', 'In the midst of this atmosphere, which must\\ninfallibly have smothered any other man, Mr Quilp passed the evening\\nwith great cheerfulness; solacing himself all the time with the pipe\\nand the case-bottle; and occasionally entertaining himself with a\\nmelodious howl, intended for a song, but bearing not the faintest\\nresemblance to any scrap of any piece of music, vocal or instrumental,\\never invented by man.', 'Thus he amused himself until nearly midnight,\\nwhen he turned into his hammock with the utmost satisfaction.', 'The first sound that met his ears in the morning--as he half opened his\\neyes, and, finding himself so unusually near the ceiling, entertained a\\ndrowsy idea that he must have been transformed into a fly or\\nblue-bottle in the course of the night,--was that of a stifled sobbing\\nand weeping in the room.', 'Peeping cautiously over the side of his\\nhammock, he descried Mrs Quilp, to whom, after contemplating her for\\nsome time in silence, he communicated a violent start by suddenly\\nyelling out--‘Halloa!’\\n\\n‘Oh, Quilp!’ cried his poor little wife, looking up.', '‘How you\\nfrightened me!’\\n\\n‘I meant to, you jade,’ returned the dwarf.', '‘What do you want here?', 'I’m dead, an’t I?’\\n\\n‘Oh, please come home, do come home,’ said Mrs Quilp, sobbing; ‘we’ll\\nnever do so any more, Quilp, and after all it was only a mistake that\\ngrew out of our anxiety.’\\n\\n‘Out of your anxiety,’ grinned the dwarf.', '‘Yes, I know that--out of\\nyour anxiety for my death.', 'I shall come home when I please, I tell\\nyou.', 'I shall come home when I please, and go when I please.', 'I’ll be a\\nWill o’ the Wisp, now here, now there, dancing about you always,\\nstarting up when you least expect me, and keeping you in a constant\\nstate of restlessness and irritation.', 'Will you begone?’\\n\\nMrs Quilp durst only make a gesture of entreaty.', '‘I tell you no,’ cried the dwarf.', '‘No.', 'If you dare to come here again\\nunless you’re sent for, I’ll keep watch-dogs in the yard that’ll growl\\nand bite--I’ll have man-traps, cunningly altered and improved for\\ncatching women--I’ll have spring guns, that shall explode when you\\ntread upon the wires, and blow you into little pieces.', 'Will you\\nbegone?’\\n\\n‘Do forgive me.', 'Do come back,’ said his wife, earnestly.', '‘No-o-o-o-o!’ roared Quilp.', '‘Not till my own good time, and then I’ll\\nreturn again as often as I choose, and be accountable to nobody for my\\ngoings or comings.', 'You see the door there.', 'Will you go?’\\n\\nMr Quilp delivered this last command in such a very energetic voice,\\nand moreover accompanied it with such a sudden gesture, indicative of\\nan intention to spring out of his hammock, and, night-capped as he was,\\nbear his wife home again through the public streets, that she sped away\\nlike an arrow.', 'Her worthy lord stretched his neck and eyes until she\\nhad crossed the yard, and then, not at all sorry to have had this\\nopportunity of carrying his point, and asserting the sanctity of his\\ncastle, fell into an immoderate fit of laughter, and laid himself down\\nto sleep again.', 'CHAPTER 51\\n\\nThe bland and open-hearted proprietor of Bachelor’s Hall slept on\\namidst the congenial accompaniments of rain, mud, dirt, damp, fog, and\\nrats, until late in the day; when, summoning his valet Tom Scott to\\nassist him to rise, and to prepare breakfast, he quitted his couch, and\\nmade his toilet.', 'This duty performed, and his repast ended, he again\\nbetook himself to Bevis Marks.', 'This visit was not intended for Mr Swiveller, but for his friend and\\nemployer Mr Sampson Brass.', 'Both gentlemen however were from home, nor\\nwas the life and light of law, Miss Sally, at her post either.', 'The\\nfact of their joint desertion of the office was made known to all\\ncomers by a scrap of paper in the hand-writing of Mr Swiveller, which\\nwas attached to the bell-handle, and which, giving the reader no clue\\nto the time of day when it was first posted, furnished him with the\\nrather vague and unsatisfactory information that that gentleman would\\n‘return in an hour.’\\n\\n‘There’s a servant, I suppose,’ said the dwarf, knocking at the\\nhouse-door.', '‘She’ll do.’\\n\\nAfter a sufficiently long interval, the door was opened, and a small\\nvoice immediately accosted him with, ‘Oh please will you leave a card\\nor message?’\\n\\n‘Eh?’ said the dwarf, looking down, (it was something quite new to him)\\nupon the small servant.', 'To this, the child, conducting her conversation as upon the occasion of\\nher first interview with Mr Swiveller, again replied, ‘Oh please will\\nyou leave a card or message?’\\n\\n‘I’ll write a note,’ said the dwarf, pushing past her into the office;\\n‘and mind your master has it directly he comes home.’  So Mr Quilp\\nclimbed up to the top of a tall stool to write the note, and the small\\nservant, carefully tutored for such emergencies, looked on with her\\neyes wide open, ready, if he so much as abstracted a wafer, to rush\\ninto the street and give the alarm to the police.', 'As Mr Quilp folded his note (which was soon written: being a very short\\none) he encountered the gaze of the small servant.', 'He looked at her,\\nlong and earnestly.', '‘How are you?’ said the dwarf, moistening a wafer with horrible\\ngrimaces.', 'The small servant, perhaps frightened by his looks, returned no audible\\nreply; but it appeared from the motion of her lips that she was\\ninwardly repeating the same form of expression concerning the note or\\nmessage.', '‘Do they use you ill here?', 'is your mistress a Tartar?’ said Quilp with\\na chuckle.', 'In reply to the last interrogation, the small servant, with a look of\\ninfinite cunning mingled with fear, screwed up her mouth very tight and\\nround, and nodded violently.', 'Whether there was anything in the\\npeculiar slyness of her action which fascinated Mr Quilp, or anything\\nin the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his\\nattention for some other reason; or whether it merely occurred to him\\nas a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance;\\ncertain it is, that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the\\ndesk, and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands, looked at her fixedly.', '‘Where do you come from?’ he said after a long pause, stroking his chin.', '‘I don’t know.’\\n\\n‘What’s your name?’\\n\\n‘Nothing.’\\n\\n‘Nonsense!’ retorted Quilp.', '‘What does your mistress call you when she\\nwants you?’\\n\\n‘A little devil,’ said the child.', 'She added in the same breath, as if fearful of any further questioning,\\n‘But please will you leave a card or message?’\\n\\nThese unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more\\ninquiries.', 'Quilp, however, without uttering another word, withdrew his\\neyes from the small servant, stroked his chin more thoughtfully than\\nbefore, and then, bending over the note as if to direct it with\\nscrupulous and hair-breadth nicety, looked at her, covertly but very\\nnarrowly, from under his bushy eyebrows.', 'The result of this secret\\nsurvey was, that he shaded his face with his hands, and laughed slyly\\nand noiselessly, until every vein in it was swollen almost to bursting.', 'Pulling his hat over his brow to conceal his mirth and its effects, he\\ntossed the letter to the child, and hastily withdrew.', 'Once in the street, moved by some secret impulse, he laughed, and held\\nhis sides, and laughed again, and tried to peer through the dusty area\\nrailings as if to catch another glimpse of the child, until he was\\nquite tired out.', 'At last, he travelled back to the Wilderness, which\\nwas within rifle-shot of his bachelor retreat, and ordered tea in the\\nwooden summer-house that afternoon for three persons; an invitation to\\nMiss Sally Brass and her brother to partake of that entertainment at\\nthat place, having been the object both of his journey and his note.', 'It was not precisely the kind of weather in which people usually take\\ntea in summer-houses, far less in summer-houses in an advanced state of\\ndecay, and overlooking the slimy banks of a great river at low water.', 'Nevertheless, it was in this choice retreat that Mr Quilp ordered a\\ncold collation to be prepared, and it was beneath its cracked and leaky\\nroof that he, in due course of time, received Mr Sampson and his sister\\nSally.', '‘You’re fond of the beauties of nature,’ said Quilp with a grin.', '‘Is\\nthis charming, Brass?', 'Is it unusual, unsophisticated, primitive?’\\n\\n‘It’s delightful indeed, sir,’ replied the lawyer.', '‘Cool?’ said Quilp.', '‘N-not particularly so, I think, sir,’ rejoined Brass, with his teeth\\nchattering in his head.', '‘Perhaps a little damp and ague-ish?’ said Quilp.', '‘Just damp enough to be cheerful, sir,’ rejoined Brass.', '‘Nothing more,\\nsir, nothing more.’\\n\\n‘And Sally?’ said the delighted dwarf.', '‘Does she like it?’\\n\\n‘She’ll like it better,’ returned that strong-minded lady, ‘when she\\nhas tea; so let us have it, and don’t bother.’\\n\\n‘Sweet Sally!’ cried Quilp, extending his arms as if about to embrace\\nher.', '‘Gentle, charming, overwhelming Sally.’\\n\\n‘He’s a very remarkable man indeed!’ soliloquised Mr Brass.', '‘He’s\\nquite a Troubadour, you know; quite a Troubadour!’\\n\\nThese complimentary expressions were uttered in a somewhat absent and\\ndistracted manner; for the unfortunate lawyer, besides having a bad\\ncold in his head, had got wet in coming, and would have willingly borne\\nsome pecuniary sacrifice if he could have shifted his present raw\\nquarters to a warm room, and dried himself at a fire.', 'Quilp,\\nhowever--who, beyond the gratification of his demon whims, owed Sampson\\nsome acknowledgment of the part he had played in the mourning scene of\\nwhich he had been a hidden witness, marked these symptoms of uneasiness\\nwith a delight past all expression, and derived from them a secret joy\\nwhich the costliest banquet could never have afforded him.', 'It is worthy of remark, too, as illustrating a little feature in the\\ncharacter of Miss Sally Brass, that, although on her own account she\\nwould have borne the discomforts of the Wilderness with a very ill\\ngrace, and would probably, indeed, have walked off before the tea\\nappeared, she no sooner beheld the latent uneasiness and misery of her\\nbrother than she developed a grim satisfaction, and began to enjoy\\nherself after her own manner.', 'Though the wet came stealing through the\\nroof and trickling down upon their heads, Miss Brass uttered no\\ncomplaint, but presided over the tea equipage with imperturbable\\ncomposure.', 'While Mr Quilp, in his uproarious hospitality, seated\\nhimself upon an empty beer-barrel, vaunted the place as the most\\nbeautiful and comfortable in the three kingdoms, and elevating his\\nglass, drank to their next merry-meeting in that jovial spot; and Mr\\nBrass, with the rain plashing down into his tea-cup, made a dismal\\nattempt to pluck up his spirits and appear at his ease; and Tom Scott,\\nwho was in waiting at the door under an old umbrella, exulted in his\\nagonies, and bade fair to split his sides with laughing; while all this\\nwas passing, Miss Sally Brass, unmindful of the wet which dripped down\\nupon her own feminine person and fair apparel, sat placidly behind the\\ntea-board, erect and grizzly, contemplating the unhappiness of her\\nbrother with a mind at ease, and content, in her amiable disregard of\\nself, to sit there all night, witnessing the torments which his\\navaricious and grovelling nature compelled him to endure and forbade\\nhim to resent.', 'And this, it must be observed, or the illustration\\nwould be incomplete, although in a business point of view she had the\\nstrongest sympathy with Mr Sampson, and would have been beyond measure\\nindignant if he had thwarted their client in any one respect.', 'In the height of his boisterous merriment, Mr Quilp, having on some\\npretence dismissed his attendant sprite for the moment, resumed his\\nusual manner all at once, dismounted from his cask, and laid his hand\\nupon the lawyer’s sleeve.', '‘A word,’ said the dwarf, ‘before we go farther.', 'Sally, hark’ee for a\\nminute.’\\n\\nMiss Sally drew closer, as if accustomed to business conferences with\\ntheir host which were the better for not having air.', '‘Business,’ said the dwarf, glancing from brother to sister.', '‘Very\\nprivate business.', 'Lay your heads together when you’re by yourselves.’\\n\\n‘Certainly, sir,’ returned Brass, taking out his pocket-book and\\npencil.', '‘I’ll take down the heads if you please, sir.', 'Remarkable\\ndocuments,’ added the lawyer, raising his eyes to the ceiling, ‘most\\nremarkable documents.', 'He states his points so clearly that it’s a\\ntreat to have ‘em!', 'I don’t know any act of parliament that’s equal to\\nhim in clearness.’\\n\\n‘I shall deprive you of a treat,’ said Quilp.', '‘Put up your book.', 'We\\ndon’t want any documents.', 'So.', 'There’s a lad named Kit--’\\n\\nMiss Sally nodded, implying that she knew of him.', '‘Kit!’ said Mr Sampson.--‘Kit!', 'Ha!', 'I’ve heard the name before, but I\\ndon’t exactly call to mind--I don’t exactly--’\\n\\n‘You’re as slow as a tortoise, and more thick-headed than a\\nrhinoceros,’ returned his obliging client with an impatient gesture.', '‘He’s extremely pleasant!’ cried the obsequious Sampson.', '‘His\\nacquaintance with Natural History too is surprising.', 'Quite a Buffoon,\\nquite!’\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Mr Brass intended some compliment or other; and\\nit has been argued with show of reason that he would have said Buffon,\\nbut made use of a superfluous vowel.', 'Be this as it may, Quilp gave him\\nno time for correction, as he performed that office himself by more\\nthan tapping him on the head with the handle of his umbrella.', '‘Don’t let’s have any wrangling,’ said Miss Sally, staying his hand.', '‘I’ve showed you that I know him, and that’s enough.’\\n\\n‘She’s always foremost!’ said the dwarf, patting her on the back and\\nlooking contemptuously at Sampson.', '‘I don’t like Kit, Sally.’\\n\\n‘Nor I,’ rejoined Miss Brass.', '‘Nor I,’ said Sampson.', '‘Why, that’s right!’ cried Quilp.', '‘Half our work is done already.', 'This Kit is one of your honest people; one of your fair characters; a\\nprowling prying hound; a hypocrite; a double-faced, white-livered,\\nsneaking spy; a crouching cur to those that feed and coax him, and a\\nbarking yelping dog to all besides.’\\n\\n‘Fearfully eloquent!’ cried Brass with a sneeze.', '‘Quite appalling!’\\n\\n‘Come to the point,’ said Miss Sally, ‘and don’t talk so much.’\\n\\n‘Right again!’ exclaimed Quilp, with another contemptuous look at\\nSampson, ‘always foremost!', 'I say, Sally, he is a yelping, insolent dog\\nto all besides, and most of all, to me.', 'In short, I owe him a grudge.’\\n‘That’s enough, sir,’ said Sampson.', '‘No, it’s not enough, sir,’ sneered Quilp; ‘will you hear me out?', 'Besides that I owe him a grudge on that account, he thwarts me at this\\nminute, and stands between me and an end which might otherwise prove a\\ngolden one to us all.', 'Apart from that, I repeat that he crosses my\\nhumour, and I hate him.', 'Now, you know the lad, and can guess the rest.', 'Devise your own means of putting him out of my way, and execute them.', 'Shall it be done?’\\n\\n‘It shall, sir,’ said Sampson.', '‘Then give me your hand,’ retorted Quilp.', '‘Sally, girl, yours.', 'I rely\\nas much, or more, on you than him.', 'Tom Scott comes back.', 'Lantern,\\npipes, more grog, and a jolly night of it!’\\n\\nNo other word was spoken, no other look exchanged, which had the\\nslightest reference to this, the real occasion of their meeting.', 'The\\ntrio were well accustomed to act together, and were linked to each\\nother by ties of mutual interest and advantage, and nothing more was\\nneeded.', 'Resuming his boisterous manner with the same ease with which\\nhe had thrown it off, Quilp was in an instant the same uproarious,\\nreckless little savage he had been a few seconds before.', 'It was ten\\no’clock at night before the amiable Sally supported her beloved and\\nloving brother from the Wilderness, by which time he needed the utmost\\nsupport her tender frame could render; his walk being from some unknown\\nreason anything but steady, and his legs constantly doubling up in\\nunexpected places.', 'Overpowered, notwithstanding his late prolonged slumbers, by the\\nfatigues of the last few days, the dwarf lost no time in creeping to\\nhis dainty house, and was soon dreaming in his hammock.', 'Leaving him to\\nvisions, in which perhaps the quiet figures we quitted in the old\\nchurch porch were not without their share, be it our task to rejoin\\nthem as they sat and watched.', 'CHAPTER 52\\n\\nAfter a long time, the schoolmaster appeared at the wicket-gate of the\\nchurchyard, and hurried towards them, tingling in his hand, as he came\\nalong, a bundle of rusty keys.', 'He was quite breathless with pleasure\\nand haste when he reached the porch, and at first could only point\\ntowards the old building which the child had been contemplating so\\nearnestly.', '‘You see those two old houses,’ he said at last.', '‘Yes, surely,’ replied Nell.', '‘I have been looking at them nearly all\\nthe time you have been away.’\\n\\n‘And you would have looked at them more curiously yet, if you could\\nhave guessed what I have to tell you,’ said her friend.', '‘One of those\\nhouses is mine.’\\n\\nWithout saying any more, or giving the child time to reply, the\\nschoolmaster took her hand, and, his honest face quite radiant with\\nexultation, led her to the place of which he spoke.', 'They stopped before its low arched door.', 'After trying several of the\\nkeys in vain, the schoolmaster found one to fit the huge lock, which\\nturned back, creaking, and admitted them into the house.', 'The room into which they entered was a vaulted chamber once nobly\\nornamented by cunning architects, and still retaining, in its beautiful\\ngroined roof and rich stone tracery, choice remnants of its ancient\\nsplendour.', 'Foliage carved in the stone, and emulating the mastery of\\nNature’s hand, yet remained to tell how many times the leaves outside\\nhad come and gone, while it lived on unchanged.', 'The broken figures\\nsupporting the burden of the chimney-piece, though mutilated, were\\nstill distinguishable for what they had been--far different from the\\ndust without--and showed sadly by the empty hearth, like creatures who\\nhad outlived their kind, and mourned their own too slow decay.', 'In some old time--for even change was old in that old place--a wooden\\npartition had been constructed in one part of the chamber to form a\\nsleeping-closet, into which the light was admitted at the same period\\nby a rude window, or rather niche, cut in the solid wall.', 'This screen,\\ntogether with two seats in the broad chimney, had at some forgotten\\ndate been part of the church or convent; for the oak, hastily\\nappropriated to its present purpose, had been little altered from its\\nformer shape, and presented to the eye a pile of fragments of rich\\ncarving from old monkish stalls.', 'An open door leading to a small room or cell, dim with the light that\\ncame through leaves of ivy, completed the interior of this portion of\\nthe ruin.', 'It was not quite destitute of furniture.', 'A few strange\\nchairs, whose arms and legs looked as though they had dwindled away\\nwith age; a table, the very spectre of its race: a great old chest that\\nhad once held records in the church, with other quaintly-fashioned\\ndomestic necessaries, and store of fire-wood for the winter, were\\nscattered around, and gave evident tokens of its occupation as a\\ndwelling-place at no very distant time.', 'The child looked around her, with that solemn feeling with which we\\ncontemplate the work of ages that have become but drops of water in the\\ngreat ocean of eternity.']\n"
